After learning guitar from her older brother and through music lessons at the ripe age of twelve while writing songs at the same time, Claire Radel's musical journey has bloomed ever since. 

In 2016 she released her first single "Your Lovin' and You" recorded at Gaither Studios, mix and mastered by two time Grammy award winning engineer Chad Evans. She released her first EP in 2018 "You're Askin' for It" which garnered a comment from mentor Doug Showalter (producer/guitarist/drummer who has worked with country singer Cam, Harry Styles, Lennon Stella, Maren Morris, Miley Cyrus and many others) he gave an encouraging review:

"Claire Radel has a voice and narrative that is far beyond her years. Her ability to tell stories of teenage love in a way that any listener can relate to showcases a talent that has the brightest of bright futures. Brighter then she’s probably even aware of. And that’s a very good thing."

Throughout the past several years she has continued to hone in her sound, experimenting with folk-pop and indie influences while working with former SONY/ATV Nashville producer Michael Estok. Her latest song "The One" released in 2021 caught the attention of film and TV publishing company The Music Playground in New York city, which lead her to sign her first sync licensing deal; that same year she was recognized by the Nashville Songwriters Association as "One to Watch". 

Claire has performed at many notable venues over the past several years in Nashville, TN (The Bluebird Café / The Listening Room, Pigeon Forge) and in her home state of Indiana. One notable opportunity was in 2017, opening for American Idol winner David Cook for a local music festival.  

She is now living full time in Nashville, TN after traveling back and forth from Indiana at  the age of 13, where she continues to chase her dreams, write songs, perform, and continues to produce music. Claire has several new songs coming out this year and plans to become more immersed in the Nashville music scene.
