Here is a song I wrote tonight called “I Can’t Shake You” singing quiet because the fam is asleep! Hope you enjoy, I’ll post the verse/chorus below once I get it down you can expect a full video!!

LYRICS:

Dreams your always in my dreams and it kills me because they seem so real/  
Flashbacks they come and go like the night we first met and then our time in June/  
There’s always something there to remind me of what could’ve been and what I need to leave behind me  
But I can’t shake you no matter how hard I try thinking about what we could’ve had and if we can still try I can’t shake you-o-o   your always on my mind i don’t know what to do I can’t shake you-o-o-o
