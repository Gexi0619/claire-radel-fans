sometimes people are dealing with more than others realize. lately i haven’t been in the best headspace mentally. i haven’t been eating regularly, have had more anxiety recently and feeling emotionally drained. i do have my moments where i’m creating like this morning and this past week and i have been eating more - i’ve recently started therapy the last three weeks and am excited to finally begin my healing journey as i have a lot to work through. if you’ve noticed me not posting as much this has partially contributed as to why. i also don’t have the best relationship with my phone or social media so for the time being i am taking a break. take care of yourselves friends! i hope this song resonates with you. ![🕊️](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tba/1/16/1f54a.png)
