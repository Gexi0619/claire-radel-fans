Good morning!! Here is a snippet of a brand new song I recently wrote with Mike Mains of [Mike Mains & The Branches](https://www.facebook.com/mikemainsmusic?__cft__[0]=AZWWkAejTK_I7bD9-Q1hdGsE3_Whda7xt66Gv32w7aNJd24vNAL6zbdv2FpfcTRlNP6CV7xYktNh49b9IrAzM6GWaKB81hZmwan-zPDV_FJyKEFuvZNazixfohdN8IJ5u4OViG_gSIrF6bYW14JWTywPvsHbIdlqZpQ97sGCWJYUj0aNdknXtHIvc2cpgT-ZavpR4hpLF9qs715uzNL4lcZJetLMdlOukY8Me_zriXd7PA&__tn__=-]K-R) called ‚ÄúSomeone New‚Äù - also if you haven‚Äôt heard of them you should absolutely go listen to their music as they have a new album coming out this September!!! ALSO - THANK YOU for getting me into the TOP 10 for Opening Act‚Äôs competition to perform in NYC!!! Voting ends August 10th

Hope this song resonates with you - and if it does you‚Äôre not alone ![ü§ç](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tc5/1/16/1f90d.png) (PS - GO LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC THEY ARE MY FAVES & THEY HAVE A NEW SONG OUT TODAY!!! ![üéâ](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t8c/1/16/1f389.png))
