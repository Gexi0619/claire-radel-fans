"One more song, and this is called You're Askin' For It, off of my EP. And this is inspired by a friend of mine in high school. There was like a ton of drama my senior year. And she, this guy she liked, had a girlfriend. And he cheated on his girlfriend to be with her. And then they ended up breaking up. And then now they've been together for like two years. And when I told her that like I wrote a song about it, she was like, 'Oh that's so cool.' I'm just like, 'Okay, well, whatever.' But this is called You're Askin' For It. So here we go."

## Lyrics

Did you honestly believe she wouldn't find out?  
About those late-night phone calls, kissing in the school halls, and taking you out on the town?  
Your friends all tried to warn ya, but look where that's got you now  

You're asking for it if you think sneaking out is gonna help you now  
You're asking for it if he tells you you're the one he wants and he's just fooling around  
You're asking for it, but it's too late now, cause she found out  

Now it's not the first time he's been with two or three girls at a time  
Even though you knew about her, you still had him on your mind  
Your friends all tried to warn ya, but look where that's got you now  

You're asking for it if you think sneaking out is gonna help you now  
You're asking for it if he tells you you're the one he wants and he's just fooling around  
You're asking for it, but it's too late now, cause she found out  

Yeah, he's got a way with words  
But you're not the only one who's gonna give her  

You're asking for it if you think sneaking out is gonna help you now  
You're asking for it if he tells you you're the one he wants and he's just fooling around  
You're asking for it if you think sneaking out is gonna help you now  
You're asking for it if you tell me you're the one he wants and he is just fooling around  
You're asking for it  
But it's too late now  
Yeah, it's too late now  
Cause she found out  
Yeah, it's too late now  
Cause she found out  
Yeah, it's too late now  
Cause she found out
