What was the first song you played at Bluebird? Uh, that's been a really long time ago. The first time I played at Bluebird was in like 2017. Um, I think I, what did I do then? I probably did Your Lovin' and You, which is like the first song I put out. I haven't played that one in a really long time. Um, but I can attempt it. We'll see how it goes. This is like throwback to me when I was like, I think I wrote this when I was like 16. And it was after, it was after like this open mic night that I had that I went to. And I met this guy and I thought he was cute. And then I went home and I like wrote this song down. I don't know if that's like, has any correlation to the song. I don't really think it does. But, you know what? I can say that that guy inspired it. Kind of. Just cause he was cute. I don't know. Maybe not. Um, but anyways. I just remember that. I didn't have any paper, like I didn't have any notebook paper to write it down on. So I remember, um, I think I still have it, but I think I wrote it down on like an envelope that I found. Um, and I just like wrote it all down and then I woke up the next day and I like just put a melody to it. And then it, and then there it was. So that's the little backstory behind that song that I don't know if I've shared before. Um, but anyways. I'll attempt to play it. I haven't played it in a really long time.

## Lyrics

I don't need a lot of money  
Or my name in lights  
All I want is your lovin' everyday and night  
Some people don't know how to live their life  
But I think I've finally got it right  

Cause all your lovin' is all I need  
It's enough to keep me standing on my feet  
Doesn't matter where I go  
Or what I do  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  

We've been all around the country seen some beautiful sights  
But the best part of it all is when you'd hold me at night  
Can't believe I've found someone like you  
Honestly you're like a dream come true  

Cause all your lovin' is all I need  
It's enough to keep me standing on my feet  
Doesn't matter where I go  
Or what I do  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  

I feel so alone when you're gone  
But I know our love will always stay strong, strong  

Cause all your lovin' is all I need  
It's enough to keep me standing on my feet  
Doesn't matter where I go  
Or what I do  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you  
As long as I've got your lovin' and you.
