## Lyrics

He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee  
He doesn't care if my hair's all fixed up or messy  
He says he can't tell the difference on whether or not I have on makeup  
And he texts me every morning whenever he wakes up  
Never thought I'd find someone else like him again  
But I swear this one's better than the rest of them  

Cuz this is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

My friends say we got something special  
And everything with us is natural  
I think that they wish that they had it  
Cause the boys that they're with have been too dramatic  

This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

Even through ups and downs we still make it  
And I know when you say I love you you don't fake it  
This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more

### Fierce & Fabulous Rebolution

> This single centres around discovering that certain someone you deeply fall for & sincerely trust. You no longer need to search for someone to keep the spark alive, as you’ve already found them.
>
> The song carries a soulful-pop influence that gradually glides alongside the lyrics to provide a foundation for the lyrical story to take centre stage.
>
> Claire provides a feel-good vocal performance that highlights the heartfelt characteristics within the beautifully divine undertones of her soulfully gratifying voice.
>
> This song shows a new side of Claire’s musical talents while remaining in keeping with the unique creative spark we’ve come to love from this talented musician. Claire is a wonderful lyricist who brings a sense of heartfelt significance with every song & this latest piece is clearly no exception.

### Music On The Move

> Whether it be romantic or platonic, we’ve all experienced an abrupt departure from someone we loved, seemingly out of nowhere. Perfectly captured in poignant lyrics like, *“Something’s missing tonight/ I’m in your sweater but I feel colder”,* Radel takes you through the rollercoaster of emotions that come when a relationship ends unexpectedly. Set against musical accompaniment that feels as calming, yet equally enveloping as an ocean wave, ‘Like You Love Me’ is bound to make every emotion wash over you, all in the span of three minutes. Press play and go feel your feelings, friend!
