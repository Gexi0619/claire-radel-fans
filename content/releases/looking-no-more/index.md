## Lyrics

He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee  
He doesn't care if my hair's all fixed up or messy  
He says he can't tell the difference on whether or not I have on makeup  
And he texts me every morning whenever he wakes up  
Never thought I'd find someone else like him again  
But I swear this one's better than the rest of them  

Cuz this is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

My friends say we got something special  
And everything with us is natural  
I think that they wish that they had it  
Cause the boys that they're with have been too dramatic  

This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

Even through ups and downs we still make it  
And I know when you say I love you you don't fake it  
This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more

### Roadie Music

> ... ele trafega entre nuances do Pop e do Folk, gerando de tal forma uma m√∫sica muito agrad√°vel de se ouvir, com √≥timas melodias e arranjos, capazes de envolver o ouvinte durante a audi√ß√£o, tudo complementado pela √≥tima voz de Claire. Aproveitando o lan√ßamento, ela falou um pouco mais a respeito da nova m√∫sica:
>
> > ‚ÄúEssa m√∫sica √© uma vers√£o honesta de estar apaixonado e o sentimento e a realidade de estar com algu√©m que √© bom para voc√™. Onde voc√™ n√£o precisa continuar procurando ‚Äúaquele‚Äù porque encontrou a pessoa com quem deseja estar.‚Äù

English version:

> ... it travels between Pop and Folk nuances, generating in such a way a very pleasant song to listen to, with great melodies and arrangements, capable of involving the listener during the audition, all complemented by the great voice of Claire. Taking advantage of the launch, she spoke a little more about the new song:
>
> > ‚ÄúThis song is an honest version of being in love and the feeling and reality of being with someone who is good for you. Where you don't have to keep looking for "the one" because you've found the person you want to be with."

### Fierce & Fabulous Rebolution

> This single centres around discovering that certain someone you deeply fall for & sincerely trust. You no longer need to search for someone to keep the spark alive, as you‚Äôve already found them.
>
> The song carries a soulful-pop influence that gradually glides alongside the lyrics to provide a foundation for the lyrical story to take centre stage.
>
> Claire provides a feel-good vocal performance that highlights the heartfelt characteristics within the beautifully divine undertones of her soulfully gratifying voice.
>
> This song shows a new side of Claire‚Äôs musical talents while remaining in keeping with the unique creative spark we‚Äôve come to love from this talented musician. Claire is a wonderful lyricist who brings a sense of heartfelt significance with every song & this latest piece is clearly no exception.

### Music On The Move

> Whether it be romantic or platonic, we‚Äôve all experienced an abrupt departure from someone we loved, seemingly out of nowhere. Perfectly captured in poignant lyrics like, *‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs missing tonight/ I‚Äôm in your sweater but I feel colder‚Äù,* Radel takes you through the rollercoaster of emotions that come when a relationship ends unexpectedly. Set against musical accompaniment that feels as calming, yet equally enveloping as an ocean wave, ‚ÄòLike You Love Me‚Äô is bound to make every emotion wash over you, all in the span of three minutes. Press play and go feel your feelings, friend!
