there's one song I haven't played, I didn't play it on my last live stream, but it's also another original, and um okay I had to get in the groove with it first because I haven't played it in a while, um but it's called Not What I Want, and this one I'm really excited for, and um I hope you guys enjoy, this is another one that should be out soon too, this year, sometime, I'm not sure what to do
