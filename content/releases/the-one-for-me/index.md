"Fun fact, I actually originally wrote the one for me on ukulele. Fun fact of the day. I'm trying to think of how I did it, though, because it's different. I think it's different than what I do on guitar, because I can't remember. Because for the chorus on guitar, I don't have an Am in there, but then when I do it on the ukulele, I add an Am in the chorus. So, I'm going to do that."

"Someone said, can you play, the one... okay, okay, fine, I will do that song. That's another song that's, um, older, that is on my EP, you're asking for it. So, I will play that one real quick since you've requested it, cause, why not? Um, hopefully I don't mess up that one. This is the one for me, I'll play it for you, sir, that requested it, thank you"

## Lyrics

Hey I know we just met  
But there's something that I don't quite get  
Why are you all here alone  
it seems someone like you would have someone to hold  

Don't get me wrong you seem just like the guy for me  
might come off a little shy but really I  

Just want a hand to hold  
someone to call me when I'm feeling low  
and I can't help but think  
that you're the one for me  

There's something about his eyes  
that make me feel something I can''t describe  
I just cant believe  
that he's sitting here across from me  

I dont need anything serious  
all I really want is someone I can trust cause I  

Just want a hand to hold  
someone to call me when I'm feeling low  
and I can't help but think  
that you're the one for me  

Just want a hand to hold  
someone to call me when I'm feeling low  
and I can't help but think  
that you're the one for me
