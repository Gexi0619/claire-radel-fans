I thought I would do one and give you a little bit of an update on my music. I may or may not have some new music coming out soon. I'm really excited to share with you. So, yeah, okay. I'm going to play one of those new songs. It's called Like You Love Me. It's a song I wrote with Marcus Waddell that I met earlier this year. He's a producer based in Indianapolis. He's super cool to work with. I'm really excited for this song because it's good. It's a good one. So I'll play that one now. Oh, and it's called Like You Love Me. You probably want to know the title. And it's coming soon. Not sure when, but it will be out eventually.

I'll do a newer original song. This is called Like You Love Me, and it is a newer song that I wrote with Marcus Waddell. He is a producer in Indianapolis. He's super cool. He's really fun to work with, and we wrote this one. I can't talk. I'm going to be releasing it soon. I don't know when yet. I'll keep you guys updated. Hopefully before the end of the year, though. Definitely. So, be on the lookout for this one.

Alright so this next song is original, called Like You Love Me. And it should be out sometime this year. This is probably my favorite.

I'll just do another song. But I gotta think of how it goes. Cause I haven't played it in a minute. And it's my own song. And you'd think that I would like know. But when you don't play shows for like a month. And it's like oh I don't have to practice for anything. And you're just like okay cool. I can just sit on my phone all day. But then when I go to do this I'm like okay no. I actually have to be prepared. So this is another original. And this is called Like you love me. And I've played this out on here before. But this is new. And this is gonna be released this year. I just need to get pictures done. It's kind of taking a little bit of time. But I'm really excited for this one. And I hope you guys like it.

I'm so excited because, you know why? Um, I've got a song coming out in 13 days. Not like I've been counting down or anything, you know? Um, so I'm really excited about that. That's coming out June 3rd. And I originally meant for it to be released July 3rd, but I'm terrible with months, so I am sticking to June 3rd instead. So, it is called "Like You Love Me." And, um, I wrote it with my producer friend, Marcus Waddell. And he's super cool and awesome, and he's really good at what he does. And he's super cool to work with. I had a really great time working with him. And you guys should also go check out his stuff because he's got his own independent stuff that he does too. And it's under "Cradle Cat," and it's really good. He does all his production, and it's like I wish I could be as good as him because he's still learning. So we're both, like, learning together, and it's really cool just to have someone that knows what they're doing but they're still learning more about their craft. Um, so it's really fun to work with him. So, be on the lookout for that one. That's June 3rd, so that's coming up soon. And I'll start off with that one. So, I hope you guys like it. Alright, I hope you guys enjoy this one. This is called "Like You Love Me."

So, I thought I would fill you guys in on my next single that I will be releasing. It comes out on June 3rd, and I'm super excited. I would play you a snippet of it, but I already posted that one video with about 9 seconds on it. Anyway, the song is called "Like You Love Me," and it comes out in like 13 days. For that, I'll be doing a virtual release party. I'll start that at 10 PM on the 2nd and then go until 12 AM on the 3rd. That way, I'll be awake when it releases at 12 AM on the 3rd. If you would like to join me for that, feel free. We're gonna have a party. I'm gonna set up some Christmas lights, and I'm gonna bake cookies. I hope you guys like it because I'm really excited about it, and it's new and stuff. I'm gonna see if I can get some t-shirts made. I'll probably do a limited amount and just do a giveaway. I've got some other ideas for some stuff, not a lot, nothing too crazy.

Also, one of my other friends, his name's DeRay, he's super cool. He has an album coming out on the 12th of June, and I'm featured on one of his tracks. So, I really appreciate him allowing me to collaborate and write some lyrics for the song. You guys should check that out too because that's gonna be dope. It's gonna be super cool. I'm excited. I haven't even heard the finished product yet, so I don't even know what it's gonna sound like. But yeah, we've got some cool stuff coming out this year.

And I also, not only those two, but I have a song that I'll be releasing, another single, besides "Like You Love Me." And that one I worked on with Corey West. It's a song that I had already had a track on my phone or on my iPad that I had built up. Later, I transferred it to my phone and just worked on it that way. I brought it to him and was like, "Hey, can you help me do this because I'm not very tech-savvy when it comes to production yet?" Even though I've been doing it for about a year, just messing around with it last summer. I do stuff on my phone and now my iPad, but I'm nowhere near where I want to be. But I'm still working on it.

Anyway, with that one, I was like, "Hey, can you help me with this?" And he was like, "Yeah, for sure." So, he just helped me with the production side of everything because I'm not that good at that stuff yet. So, that one's super cool. They're both very much different.

I didn’t win tonight’s competitions - but I did win in new connections, hearing really great songwriters and being surrounded by such an encouraging group of people!!! Tonight was so much fun and I’m so thankful for the opportunity. They had @chaserice’s bass player as one of the judges, it was really cool to hear his input, encouragement and advice!!! @redbicyclethenations [Music City Movement](https://www.facebook.com/MusicCityMovement?__cft__[0]=AZXNM3e8HrTzTfxMYWlKHUlqZYT-pFUhdM5E-tOEYjpv4aLVi2zaO_ReeDIrKH0YlWf4PfmylgtEK8DF9gqV9wM2JOJabdQIIbF7ik5MK8f3i3dX8PB5X4PbxuzeahUsMNcxdh51Q_mIG04iwY4NL2GQmS5Jhpye5TeNVlIkkuSSNOuGwyE3IGJCb9IkuY3n6qqdEkXqevDUDvceUkcHlLMb&__tn__=-]K-R) [Soundspace](https://www.facebook.com/SNDSPC?__cft__[0]=AZXNM3e8HrTzTfxMYWlKHUlqZYT-pFUhdM5E-tOEYjpv4aLVi2zaO_ReeDIrKH0YlWf4PfmylgtEK8DF9gqV9wM2JOJabdQIIbF7ik5MK8f3i3dX8PB5X4PbxuzeahUsMNcxdh51Q_mIG04iwY4NL2GQmS5Jhpye5TeNVlIkkuSSNOuGwyE3IGJCb9IkuY3n6qqdEkXqevDUDvceUkcHlLMb&__tn__=-]K-R)
