This song is now on all streaming platforms and I could not be more proud of how it turned out! Thank you to the awesome production by [@courtstreetproduction](https://www.instagram.com/_u/courtstreetproduction) and to my co-writer [@trevorpeverley](https://www.instagram.com/_u/trevorpeverley) for always helping bring ideas to life!!

We wrote this song back in 2021, and I’ve always loved it. I remember when we were writing the bridge and the phrasing / melody just seemed to flow out. (That’s also my favorite part of the song ![😂](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/td0/1/16/1f602.png)). This song is for those of you going through heartbreak, loss, difficult times or anything that you feel can relate this to. Much love and I’m so thankful to work with such talented people! ![🫶🏼](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t85/1/16/1faf6_1f3fc.png)

The song, written by Radel and Canada based producer/songwriter, Trevor Peverley in 2021, boasts a runtime of nearly five minutes.
