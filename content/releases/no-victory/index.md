Alright, so, I'm gonna start off with my newer original song, uh, that I co-wrote this with Marcus Waddell, um, and he is an Indianapolis-based producer, songwriter, um, and he's been really great to work with, uh, so far, and, um, I've got two songs, uh, three songs that we've written, two of them I'll be releasing, uh, sometime this year, so stay tuned, I'm really excited, and, um, this is one of them, and it is called, um, No Victory.

so this is a new song. Newer song. And it is called No Victory. And I've also played this on my previous live shows. And this one I hope to be releasing this year. If I ever get to go out of the house and go finish recording vocals. But, um. We'll just have to see. But, um, yeah. So this is No Victory.

This one is one I haven't played in a minute, oof, I just knocked my guitar on the wall. This is called No Victory, and I wrote this with Marcus Waldell, who is really cool, and he's actually doing a livestream coming up on the 12th where you can see how he does his recording process and what software he uses and how he creates his songs and stuff. He's really good. I really enjoy working with him, and I hope you guys enjoy this song. We've got some other stuff too that we've done together. I've got two more songs that I've written with him, one of the others I'll be releasing this year as well, and then hopefully, once we're back to normal, I can release this one that I'm about to play and get to redo the vocals and stuff, so I'm excited for that.
