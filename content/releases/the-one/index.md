Um, I'm gonna play The One, um, which was my last release, and this song is the song that got me my first sync licensing deal with Film and TV, and um, which is super cool. Um, there is one in the works right now though, but I've been keeping it hush hush because it's not confirmed yet. But if something happens, obviously you guys will know about it and all that cool stuff. Um, so I'm gonna just play The One, and it's available wherever you stream your songs. Um, so, here we go.

## Lyrics

I caught myself scrolling through the photos of you that you recently posted  
And I didn't feel a thing I thought how I'm glad that I'm  
No longer with you I guess looks can be deceiving  
I'm glad that I'm no longer grieving  

I'm glad that I'm no longer grieving  
Had to take some time to figure some things out  
It took a while but now I'm  
Doing better than I ever have  
And that's all thanks to you  

You were my everything and I  
Was too blind to see that you  
Were no good for me and I still  
Want you to be the one  
Just you and I  
You made me feel something and I get it  
I don't know if I'll ever get that back  
I don't know if I'll ever get you back  

You were my everything and I  
Was too blind to see that you  
Were no good for me and I still  
Want you to be the one (The one)  
The one  
The one (The one)  
The one  

Even to this day they all think I've lost it  
But the only thing I've lost is your love
