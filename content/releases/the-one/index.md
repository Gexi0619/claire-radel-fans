Um, I'm gonna play The One, um, which was my last release, and this song is the song that got me my first sync licensing deal with Film and TV, and um, which is super cool. Um, there is one in the works right now though, but I've been keeping it hush hush because it's not confirmed yet. But if something happens, obviously you guys will know about it and all that cool stuff. Um, so I'm gonna just play The One, and it's available wherever you stream your songs. Um, so, here we go.

## Lyrics

[0.00s -> 13.00s]  I caught myself scrolling through the photos of you that you recently posted
[13.00s -> 18.00s]  And I didn't feel a thing
[18.00s -> 26.00s]  I thought how I'm glad that I'm no longer with you
[26.00s -> 33.00s]  I guess looks can be deceiving
[33.00s -> 41.00s]  I'm glad that I'm no longer grieving
[41.00s -> 61.00s]  I'm glad that I'm no longer grieving
[61.00s -> 68.00s]  Had to take some time, figure some things out
[68.00s -> 73.00s]  It took a while, but now I'm
[73.00s -> 78.00s]  Doing better than I ever have
[78.00s -> 85.00s]  And that's all thanks to you
[85.00s -> 90.00s]  You were my everything
[90.00s -> 95.00s]  And I was too blind to see that
[95.00s -> 100.00s]  You were no good for me
[100.00s -> 107.00s]  And I still want you to be the one
[107.00s -> 114.00s]  Just you and I
[114.00s -> 120.00s]  You make me feel something, I get it
[120.00s -> 127.00s]  I don't know if I'll ever get that back
[127.00s -> 136.00s]  I don't know if I'll ever get you back
[136.00s -> 140.00s]  You were my everything
[140.00s -> 146.00s]  And I was too blind to see that
[146.00s -> 150.00s]  You were no good for me
[150.00s -> 160.00s]  And I still want you to be the one
[177.00s -> 186.00s]  Even to this day, they all think I've lost it
[186.00s -> 194.00s]  But the only thing I've lost is your love
[206.00s -> 211.00s]  Thanks for watching!
