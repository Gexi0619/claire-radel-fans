Also, one of my other friends, his name's DeRay, he's super cool. He has an album coming out on the 12th of June, and I'm featured on one of his tracks. So, I really appreciate him allowing me to collaborate and write some lyrics for the song. You guys should check that out too because that's gonna be dope. It's gonna be super cool. I'm excited. I haven't even heard the finished product yet, so I don't even know what it's gonna sound like. But yeah, we've got some cool stuff coming out this year.
