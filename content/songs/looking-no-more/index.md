## Lyrics

He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee  
He doesn't care if my hair's all fixed up or messy  
He says he can't tell the difference on whether or not I have on makeup  
And he texts me every morning whenever he wakes up  
Never thought I'd find someone else like him again  
But I swear this one's better than the rest of them  

Cuz this is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

My friends say we got something special  
And everything with us is natural  
I think that they wish that they had it  
Cause the boys that they're with have been too dramatic  

This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more  

Even through ups and downs we still make it  
And I know when you say I love you you don't fake it  
This is the first time I've fallen  
I can truly be free  
With someone who wants nothing but to  
Be the best for me  
All of my past aches and mistakes  
Could have only done one thing  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
And that's led me to you and now I don't have to keep  
Looking no more  
Looking no more
