"This next song is called Someone's Gonna Love You, and I wrote it kind of about something I was going through at the time, along with another friend of mine, who were both having boy issues at the same time, so it's kind of inspired by that, and I hope you guys enjoy."

"Alright so this is Someone Gonna Love You"

## Lyrics

I've finally realized  
You're not the one for me  
There's no time to compromise  
It just can't be  
I'd rather be honest  
Than hurt you with a lie  
But before I go tonight  
I want you to know that  

Someone's gonna love you  
More than I do  
And someone's gonna need you  
Like I used to  
I've moved on but it won't be long till  
Someone else loves you more than I do  

Things were going fine  
At least that's what I thought  
You were never truly honest  
And started being someone you're not  

Someone's gonna love you  
More than I do  
And someone's gonna need you  
Like I used to  
I've moved on but it won't be long till  
Someone else loves you more than I do  

Someone's gonna love you  
More than I do  
And someone's gonna need you  
Like I used to  
I've moved on but it won't be long till  
Someone else loves you more than I do
