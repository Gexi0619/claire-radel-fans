Hereâ€™s a side of me you never see. Got the house by myself for a few hours. #Jamming to #songs!!! Do I know my #dance moves suck? Yes. Do I know Iâ€™m #awkward? Again, yes. DO I #CARE?! A big fat heckinâ€™ no! Lifeâ€™s too short #enjoy this #video! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Sometimes you donâ€™t have great days and thatâ€™s okay!!! Today was one of those days but I got myself dancing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
John Mayer anytime you need a backup dancer let me know ðŸ˜‚
I hope this silly, awkward video brightens your day!
Maybe I should stick with just my music...ðŸ˜œ

These videos in past are usually just goofy and embarrassing but TaylorSwift is re-releasing Fearless so I have to celebrate!! I hope you all have a fun weekend and that this brightens your day!
