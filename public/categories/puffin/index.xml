      <description>The Worlds of Gail # Alone in the World The first time I saw Gail was at the orphanage: we were both in the unhappy position of having been orphaned at a particularly young age, and had ended up here in this big, foreboding house that once was a stately home, but now was used as a house-cum-school for around a hundred young kids like me and her, between the ages of four and ten.</description>

      <description>Opening the Door # Secret Life It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hard to sum up my life with Laura Jameson: she was quite a bit younger when I first met her a few years ago, a fairly tall young woman of 22, not quite skinny but certainly having curves in all the right places.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary V # January Kirsty sat on the bed in her bedroom, which looked considerably better than her old bedroom at her mother&amp;rsquo;s house, even considering that some of the time she couldn&amp;rsquo;t see it very well, which was in former times thanks to imperfectly corrected vision.</description>

      <description>Dear Diary II # January Kirsty walked slowly around the ladies clothes section of Lacey’s: a large department store, in which normally she&amp;rsquo;d be only slightly interested being as the fashions there were quite old and a bit dowdy, being the sort of things she in her youth considered entirely suitable for middle aged women, or her mother more specifically.</description>

      <description>Well, here is a story I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write for some time, it&amp;rsquo;s set in the far future and concerns a fictional heroine &amp;ldquo;Lyra Starfire&amp;rdquo; - she&amp;rsquo;s been mentioned in some older stories of mine - and this time we finally get to meet her.</description>
