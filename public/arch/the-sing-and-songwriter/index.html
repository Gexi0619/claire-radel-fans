        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>My father is a real rock fan and did not miss a concert in our city when a famous or less famous band in our city gave the honor. My twin brother and I always wanted to join himk, but we wer too small then. Instead my father often my father bought the current CD. And of course we could hear them. Consequently, we also wanted to become famous rock musicians. My brother got some drums and I got a guitar. We then found two more schoolmates and founded our own band. Actually, we did good music, but there was still something missing for the right sound and that was unfortunately my skills as a singer and player. Consequently, the other members wanted to find another guitarist and singer. Since I knew that our keyboardist Henry might have had an eye on me, I could convince him that I would still be able to do it, so we could both convince the others that we wanted to try another quarter. If I did not make any significant progress by then, I would have to leave the group.
I practiced at least three hours a day for a month every day, but it was so bewitched that no progress was apparent, either on the instrument or on the singing. When I wanted to give up, we drove to my grandma on a Sunday. Usually I slept in the car, but I was so agitated that I could not sleep. In order not to sink into dubious thoughts, I looked at the surroundings. Two villages  away from home there was an accident and therefore we were stuck in a traffic jam. Lost in my thoughts, I looked to the left, and a sign excited my attention.
&ldquo;I release talents. In a unique way. Special paying conditions apply: No money needed &ldquo;.
Would that not  be something for me? In any case, I memorized the address.</p>
<p>School holiday started the next week after, hence I had a lot of time and  I took the opportunity to go there. Since there was no bus, I took the bike.
Fortunately, the store was open. I would have expected a more friendly atmosphere. Everything was dimmed in gloomy red light. I was about to leave, when a man in his forties came from behind, and asked kindly,
&ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I saw the sign yesterday and I wish that you could release certain talents with me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then you are exactly right here. What are the talents? &quot;
&ldquo;Play guitar and sing. I&rsquo;m in a band, but I&rsquo;m probably too bad. &quot;
&ldquo;But you already know that you can not force talent.&rdquo;
A little frustrated, I replied, &ldquo;Yes, I know that, but  the sign made me curious.&rdquo;
He smiled and said, &ldquo;Not everything is lost yet. We can also make the impossible happen. &quot;
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, but it costs something.&rdquo;
&ldquo;But no money,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;But it will not be for free &quot;
&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s not for nothing, but I do not need money. Can you play blackjack? We just have to play a round. &quot;
I was confused, &ldquo;I know Blackjack , but what does that have to do with it?&rdquo;
It suddenly grew cold and much darker in the room, and the man pulled a delicate grin.
&ldquo;We play around the nature of your physical impairment.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Whaaat?&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard right. Physical impairment against talent . &quot;
I wanted to escape, but the door did not open.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s written on the sign, too. Special conditions. The trade cant be cancelled as soon as I have enough information. No one comes out. &quot;
I took my mobile and wanted to call my parents. However, I had no signal.
He continued: &ldquo;Talent against impairment. I promise what I tell. &quot;
&ldquo;No chance?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, definitely no chance.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And if I refuse to participate.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then you have to stay here for a long time. Until we do the trade. And I promise you no one will find you, and it will be infinitely boring for you. &quot;
&ldquo;But my bike is out there and my parents will find that and then I will be freed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Look out of the window. Do you see a bicycle anywhere or even where we are? &quot;
He pulled a curtain and behind it was a window. It only showed blue.
&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; I yelled.
&ldquo;Nowhere. I can do special things. Not only release talents. I&rsquo;m waiting for your decision.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You, what is your name? What about the blackjack and how does it go on? &quot;
&ldquo;My name does not matter, but you can call me Sam. So, it is so. We play exactly one round of blackjack and each one of us is betting on a physical impairment and who wins, whose impairment you get. &quot;
&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the benefit for me? I always lose. &quot;
&ldquo;No not true. I will not tell you now. What I can tell you is, you are leaving healthy from here. The handicap comes later. &quot;
&ldquo;Then I can go right away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Did not you listen? I said before. This is not a valid option. &quot;
I thought for a while. Then I asked, &ldquo;May I choose my handicap myself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, but I have a selection list.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And what is written on it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Deafness, no, this does not go in this case. Epilepsy. Scoliosis. Limb Dialysis and a lot more. This is a list with the options. &quot;
I looked through the list.
&ldquo;And what is written on it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Deafness, no, this does not go in this case. Epilepsy. Scoliosis. Limb Dialysis and a lot more. This is a list with the options. &quot;
I looked through the list.
&ldquo;No nice options.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That depends. You may choose &quot;
&ldquo;Then I take hypermetropia. This does not sound like a handicap at all &ldquo;, I blurted out. I had no idea what that was.
&ldquo;If  missis thinks so. I put arthrosis against it. Last word, are we playing? &quot;
He turned on a button and a table, and two chairs came out of the wall. There were cards on the table.
Of course I did not play. Sam, so I will call him now, did not pay any attention to me, no matter what I did, he did not talk to me again, but the room turned into a yellow cell. He brought me only to eat and drink, new clothes and washing, but he did not talk to me any more. I did not know what he was doing in the meantime.
After a week I had thought up all the essentials, since I had absolutely no distraction, and I knew that I would only get out if I would get involved in the trade.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m cracked. I would be ready to play. &quot;
The yellow cell turned back into the dark room and music began to sound in the background.
Sam appeared on the scene.
&ldquo;At your service, Miss. By the way, I am the bank. &quot;
Each of us took a seat and Sam dealed.
I got a 10 and an 8, Sam pulled an ace .That started not well. I stopped. Sam pulled a 9.
I had nearly lost. The chances of a 3 were very low. Should I give up? But hypermetropia sounded better than osteoarthritis.
Sam said, &ldquo;For three diopters, I offer you a 50% chance. Are you in?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What are diopters?&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you do not know what diopters are, then I can not explain now. But it&rsquo;s nothing really bad. &quot;
&ldquo;And how do I know you are sincere?&rdquo;
&ldquo;We use another set of cards, which contains exactly the same number of threes as other cards. You can check it before. And you may then draw. &quot;
I thought and agreed. I checked the stack with eight cards, it included four threes.
Sam then mingled the cards and laid them face down. I pulled the third card from the left. It was the three of spades.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;Yes, you won. You can go now. &quot;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it? And where are my talents now? &ldquo;.
&ldquo;Just wait. You will find a letter in your letter box &quot;
&ldquo;And if I tell my parents why I was not home for so long.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You will forget everything that happened here. Besides, only an hour of real time has passed. &quot;
Then he made a strange movement over my head and I was standing outside on the road with my bike. I wondered why I had driven to this village at all. I only knew I had told my parents that I was going to take a little bike trip and that something strange happened to me and that was important, but I did not know what it was. So I didn&rsquo;t care about  it and told no one about it.^</p>
<p>The whole rest of the week were school holidays still, so I had the chance to practice more than three hours each day. And  I could play combinations, which I had never managed before. And my singing became much more synchronous. This was by no means perfect, but finally, I saw progress.
But suddenly new problems arose. Reading was never a hobby of mine, but I had to read the scores for the songs, of course, and this became more and more difficult, as they became blurry.
On Saturday, I took a break, since I did good progress. I then told my parents at breakfast that I had some difficulty with reading. My father and I went to the optician and there I had to make a visual test. During the test, it suddenly made a click in my head and the term hyperopia came to my mind. And I knew at once that this was just another word for farsightedness, and that it had anything to do with the happenings in the village, I had no real memories. And then it did click again, and then I knew that I would be farsighted now . The measurement also confirmed this. The optician said I would be far-sighted in both eyes with plus three diopters. When he mentioned the word diopters., it made click in my head once more and a voice in it said: &ldquo;These are not the three additional diopters yet.&rdquo; I did not understand it then.
Anyway. After I could not read easily at all, the optician made a pair of spectacles with the corresponding strength, my father helped me in to choose the right frame. In the end, the optician said because I was only 16 years old, I do not always have to wear the glasses, but especially when looking at things close. If I wanted to, I could put them on, if it would help me for other purposes. Of course, I put the glasses in the case. When we were back home, my parents were worried that they had overlooked something. I had to reassure them that the problem had occurred only recently . My brother had no opinion, except that I had to memorize everything by heart, A bespactecled singer was not in his mind. And besides that, I could not sing anyways, he meant. Then I became angry and said he should shut up and we should make a short session. He agreed and was quite surprised at my guitar and singing progress.
I continued practicing the whole week, because three weeks later we wanted to meet again to practice together.
At the end of the week, I had made further progress on guitar playing and singing, but without glasses, I saw nothing at all, that means nearly nothing at all close and in the distance just moderately.</p>
<p>I was afraid. So we drove again to the optician. He was sure first that his measurements of the previous week had been correct, but after a new vision test he was completely shocked. On the basis of goodwill he changed the current lenses with new ones which had a strength of plus six diopters. After this was finished and I put them on, it clicked again and a voice in my head said that these still have not been the three additional diopters, but those were optional. I understood nothing still. In any case, I began to howl when I looked at myself in the mirror. I saw only bug eyes. I could not go to school with that look, but I could think about it two further weeks before school would start again. My father consoled me and said he did not understand everything, but that was not a end of everything.
At home, my mother burst into tears, too. My father could soothe her with the comment that the three children of our neighbors had glasses, all of them,  and they were quite normal children. My mother calmed down and said  that a letter had arrived for me. She does not know the sender Sam Diopter, she asked me who that is. And click and Sam.
I thanked her, tore the letter from her hand, and went into my room, where I immediately opend the letter and read:
&ldquo;Dear Magdalena. Here is Sam. I would like to make almost an end to the game. If you keep reading further, all the missing memories come back, NOW. &quot;
And then there was a huge click and then I could remember everything that happened to me in the village. And at the end of it all the there was just one thought: &ldquo;Read to the end&rdquo;. So I did that.
&ldquo;You remember, we have played handicap against talent. I have given you two weeks to practice, and you are certainly satisfied with the achievements, aren&rsquo;t you? You paid with your visual acuity. The better you could play the more your hypermetropia increased. This is your payment to me.
I&rsquo;ll leave you alone one week still. Then it makes click again and you have to decide whether you can continue singing and playing in such a way, that it is enough for your band or if you want to be back to normal visual acuitiy, but then you will probably not be a member of your music band at all.</p>
<p>Farsighted greetings,
Sam</p>
<p>PS: And something else, if you think you can wear glasses instead of glasses or Lasik or something like this, do not make the wrong hopes. You will not be able to tolerate contact lenses, and  Lasik isn&rsquo;t feasible, too.</p>
<p>PSS: And finally. Three diopters are left, as you know. Until now, you are on six mandatory diopters. Your current skills are sufficient for the band and amateur status. Your talents are big enough, however, that your band can be commercially successful with you as a front runner. You can activate these talents within the next two weeks, you just have to practice diligently. It would give you another three diopters. Consider it as a gift.</p>
<p>PSSS: I forgot. If you tell anyone outside the band about this letter and the events before, the entire memory will be deleted and you will never become a musician. &quot;</p>
<p>There was no more. I was slain. And what should I do now?
Then the letters disappeared from the paper and only one blank page was left.</p>
<p>I could not talk to my twin brother, he would not have understood it. He was with Dave, our bassist in a sports camp since yesterday  and I did not want to discuss it on the phone .
So there was only Henry, if he was here at all, I did not even know. But I wanted to do that in the afternoon. Now it was lunchtime.
My mother, of course, wanted to know from whom the letter was. I replied that it was from a music agent who could give us some or other performances here or there. That was enough information for my mother.</p>
<p>After lunch I called Henry. We decided that we met in the park.
I said goodbye to my parents and went to the park. When I got there, I took off the glasses as I had thought of a plan, how I could convince Henry that the band had now a front singer with thick glasses. I could see something without them, but it was incredibly exhausting.
Suddenly Henry stood in front of me, &ldquo;What happened? You sounded so excited. &quot;
&ldquo;I have a problem. It affects the band. &quot;
&ldquo;What kind of problem? That your performance does not meet the requirements is a problem. Is there another problem? &quot;
&ldquo;In some way the problem has to do with band.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You should be more precise.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have practiced a lot in the last week and I my performance got much better.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That would be good and it would be one problem less, but I would like to hear that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, I realize that, but a new problem came up. But you do not believe me anyway. It&rsquo;s a strange story. &quot;
&ldquo;What a story? I know you. You are strange at all, at least sometimes. Are you telling me the Holy Spirit sent you an inspiration? &quot;
&ldquo;Yes, something like that.&rdquo; I admitted.
&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll go home again. This is plain nonsense, &ldquo;he muttered, obviously not wrong.
&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; I begged him. I took the glasses out and put them on. Ah, it was a real relief.
Henry shrugged. &ldquo;You never told me you were far-sighted. Have you lost your contact lenses?
&ldquo;No, I have&hellip;&rdquo;
&ldquo;The glasses suit you,&rdquo; he interrupted.
I had not really expected that.
&ldquo;Say that again&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The glasses suit you, by the way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thank you. But what I wanted to say. No, I never had contact lenses. I only need the glasses since two weeks. &quot;
&ldquo;I can not believe that.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, but I can not see without them now. So it is. &quot;
And I told him the whole strange story with Sam and the blackjack game.</p>
<p>Henry looked even more amazed: &ldquo;The story is so crazy, this one couldn&rsquo;t even created by your  fantasies. And besides, I see no problem. &quot;
&ldquo;But I do.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Which audience would like to see a bespectacled girl singing ?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Girl, we live in modern times. I still see no problem. &quot;
&ldquo;But I do. And besides, what will Dave and my brother think of it? &quot;
&ldquo;Let me handle it. I have an idea&rdquo;.
&ldquo;And which one?&rdquo;
Henry did mysteriously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you now. It should be a surprise for you. I&rsquo;ll let you know when I talked to Dave and Phil about it. &quot;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re both away in a sport camp.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then you have to wait until next week when they are back home. But promise me one thing. Do not practice more hours than you did recently. &quot;
&ldquo;Why? Because in that case my glasses become even thicker and everything becomes much more difficult?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No. But that too belongs to my idea. And besides, the other two must also decide whether we want to remain an amateur band or become famous. And do not tell Phil anything, first I&rsquo;d like to talk to him. &quot;
&ldquo;Aha.&rdquo; I was curious, but Henry didn&rsquo;t come up with more details. Then we talked about other things.</p>
<p>The following Saturday, Dave and my brother came back from the camp. Phil was a bit surprised that I was wearing glasses, but I told him that it was more comfortable for me. His only comment was, &ldquo;So you can not show up on stage.&rdquo; I said nothing at all.</p>
<p>For Sunday, a joint rehearsal was planned. I knew Phil arrived half an hour earlier than I should be there. Henry had issued the dates. Phil did not know it.</p>
<p>When I came to the rehearsal room, I was impressed. Dave and Henry were wearing glasses, and Henry &rsquo;s were probably as strong as mine. Phil looked a bit grim.
&ldquo;Explain me,&rdquo; I begged.
Dave replied, &ldquo;Henry has told us about the situation. Both of us came to the conclusion that it is easier for you if we are also wearing spectacles. I am easily short-sighted anyway and can also see good enough without glasses. But I have one pair of glasses and I just put them on my nose. &quot;
&ldquo;And you, Henry?&rdquo;
He grinned and said, &ldquo;No, I do not need glasses, but I&rsquo;ll be wearing glasses for our performances in the future.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They seem as strong as mine.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;ll do GOC on stage.&rdquo;
&ldquo;GOC?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Glasses over Contacts. I wear lenses of opposite prescription. I have been able to get glasses and contacts last week.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re funny,&rdquo; I shouted.
&ldquo;So, like you,&rdquo; he countered.
&ldquo;And Phil?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Phil found the idea dumbass, but we are the majority. He can take window glass, but he does not have to. As a drummer he is not in the spotlight. &quot;
&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; I asked my brother.
&ldquo;Yes, they even threatened me with sacking. But maybe it is not as bad as I expected. &quot;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll manage it. Then let&rsquo;s get started. &quot;
Henry still interrupted me: &ldquo;One more thing. So far we had no band name. I talked to Dave about it. He found the name Optical Obsessives quite nice.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re even more strange than I thought.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile three years have passed and we are now known in the state under the name Optical Obsesssives. Even Phil wears glasses on stage but without any strength. Henry and I have come closer and are a couple now. We have agreed that I will practice the three diopters one for one. As a talent for me and thus for the band and of course also as a gift for Henry. He is exciting to get the gift.
But I fear that this will go faster than we planned, because today a letter was in the letter box.
The short letter read:
&ldquo;Dear Magdalena, I could lead you to country-wide fame. When do you want to invest the three diopters? You have two weeks to practice.</p>
<p>Sam Pretido, Concert Agent &quot;</p>
<p>I do not know yet what I should think of it. What is waiting for me this time? I&rsquo;m a bit afraid.</p>
