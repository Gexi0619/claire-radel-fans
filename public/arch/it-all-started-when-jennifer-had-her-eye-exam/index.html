          <p>It all started, when Jennifer, went for her eye exam.</p>
<p>When you grow up in the country, you can see all the neighboring farms, the woodlots, the fields, and of course, the beautiful colors of the changing seasons.
Winters, are fun, lots of snow, sleighing, skiing, and of course skating, after we have done our chores.
The greatest place, for a child to grow up.</p>
<p>My name is Katie, I have two older brothers, and a younger sister.
We go to school in town, and the bus picks us up about 7.30 a.m. and we get to our high school about a quarter to nine.
I have two close friends, Ashley, who has beautiful blond hair, and Jennifer, a redhead, with some freckles, they both live on neighboring farms.
On the bus rides to school, we have always lots to talk about.
To day, on the way home, the conversation was about Megan, how she looked, now that she is wearing glasses.
Jennifer, who is in Megan s class, thought, she looked very nice, wearing glasses, and told us Megan let her try her glasses, and how surprised she was, that when wearing the glasses, she could see everything in the distance, so much better, and so nice and clear, now, she is wondering, does she need to wear glasses.
Well, we did not have an answer for that, both Ashley, and I, don t know very much about glasses.
The next day, Jennifer told us, that when she had told her mother, who wears glasses, she was not surprised, and made an appointment for her, for Saturday, at the one hour optical store.</p>
<p>I don t know, why, Jennifer might be needing glasses, was on my mind.
All day Saturday, I was wondering, how she made out, and if she had to wear glasses, how was she going to look.
I could not wait to find out, so after supper, I gave her a phone call, to find out.
Jennifer, told me, that she is wearing her new glasses now, and loves them.
My vision, is so much better, I never realized that my vision had changed that much, and when looking at myself, I never looked this good, I love my new look.
What a surprise, she loves wearing glasses, I can hardly wait till Monday, to see, what she looks like, wearing her new glasses.
That weekend, curious to find out more about glasses, spend time on the computer.
I found out, about myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and the type of lenses, that are used.
Looking at pictures, of girls wearing glasses, had never really noticed, before, how good, most of them look wearing glasses.
I think, I am becoming obsessed with glasses, I can t believe it, and I don t know why.</p>
<p>On Monday, I watched Jennifer, getting on the bus, she was all smiles, and when she walked over to me asked, how do you like them?
I could not believe, how good she looked, a nice tortoiseshell frame, showing her bright shine eyes.
The frame, blended so nicely with the color of her hair, and skin tone.
I congratulated her, on how nice she looked, and told her, you look beautiful.
I can t believe it, but I think, I am jealous.</p>
<p>When we arrived at school, we went to the girls washroom.
Then , I could not wait any longer and asked Jennifer, if I could try her glasses, I wanted to see, what I would look like, wearing glasses.
Jennifer handed me her glasses, and when I put them on, was surprised, how comfortable they felt on my face.
I looked at myself, and was surprised, that I looked so nice wearing the glasses.
The color of the frame and my dark blond hair, blended so nicely, I looked fantastic.
Looking around through the lenses, did not improve my vision.
I was very disappointed, I had expected, I would be able to see better, wearing the glasses.
Now, that I know, I can look that good, wearing glasses, I think I would like having to wear glasses.
At home that night, I told my mother, about Jennifer, and her new glasses, and trying them, and how good I looked, she just smiled.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, Jennifer called me, and asked, if I would like to go with her, to the mall in town
Her brother has an appointment, and would drop us of at the mall.
So we went to the mall, and while we were walking around, Jennifer mentioned, she would like to go to the optical store, to get her glasses adjusted,
When we walked into the optical store, I could not believe the selection of frames.
I was like a kid in a candy store, all those glasses.
Jennifer and I had a great time, trying different frames.
I sure loved my look, wearing some of them, and now wished, more than ever, I needed to wear glasses.</p>
<p>We are now in our last year of high school, and I do a lot more studying lately, but I also seem to have more headaches
I had a suspicion, something was causing my head aches, but what was it.
When I checked on my computer, about headaches, after reading a lot, noticed that I may have, what they call an astigmatism, and to correct it, a person needed to wear glasses.
I could not believe it, I had the head aches, and to cure them, I needed to wear glasses, that would be wonderful.
When I mentioned, my frequent headaches to my mother, she made a doctor s appointment for me.
The doctor confirmed, what I had suspected, that I should have an eye exam.</p>
<p>The day, the day of my eye exam, my younger sister, Kim, came with me.
Katie, how do you feel, about the possibility, that you need to wear glasses?
Having tried some frames, when I went out, with Jenny, I am looking forward. to having to wear glasses,
You might feel the same, after trying some glasses frames, and you find out, how good you can look wearing glasses.
I am all excited, I am so sure, I will be prescribed glasses, and I am so happy, to at last wear glasses, like I wanted.
The lady optometrist, was fantastic describing to me all the procedures, and when finished told me, that I have some astigmatism, and when wearing my glasses full time, should have, very few head aches,
I only prescribed, +1/2 lenses, with the astigmatism, correction, and make sure, you have another exam, not later than a year from now.
It did not take Kim and me very long, while taking advantage of the 2 for 1 sale, to find a couple of frames, that both of us, thought looked fantastic.
Kim, told me, that she is glad, she came, she had never realized, that finding the right frames to wear, was so much fun, and she really likes, how she looks wearing glasses.</p>
<p>While waiting, for the glasses to be ready, Kim said, Katie, you are going to look fantastic wearing glasses.
I never realized, trying all the glasses frames, was so exciting.
What really impressed me, how glasses, can change your looks, and how good you can look wearing glasses.
I am sure now, that Kim likes glasses.
In the meantime, I am wondering, how I am going to look, with the lenses in the frames.
Jennifer is myopic and her lenses, makes your eye look a little smaller.
Will the +1/2 lenses, make my eyes look larger.
I now wonder, how much larger.
Well, I will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>When we went back, to the optical store, I was so excited.
My glasses were ready, and the optician, after handing me my glasses, asked me, to read from a magazine.
Fantastic, the letters were so nice and clear, and when I looked at myself in the mirror, was so pleased with my new look.
My eyes, looked fantastic behind the lenses, a think a little larger, but so nice, I am so happy.
After both pairs of glasses, were properly adjusted, and after the optician gave me my prescription , we were ready to go home.</p>
<p>When we got in the car, Kim, asked me if she could try my glasses.
I handed her, my second pair, and after she put them on, asked, well how do I look.
Kim, glasses suit you, you look very nice wearing glasses.
Katie, I never realized glasses, are so comfortable to wear, I love them, and she wore the glasses, all the way home.
I don t know, what to do about it, but I have noticed, that Kim regularly, borrows a pair of my glasses, and even wore my glasses, on a date.
She sure loves glasses, I wonder how long it will be, that she has her own glasses.</p>
<p>I am going to college now, yes, I love glasses so much, I am now studying to become an optician.
My room mate, Sandy, takes the same course.
Sandy, has black wavy hair, and wears, strong glasses for myopia, and is, I think, ia beautiful girl.
We get along well, and she loves wearing glasses as much as I do.
She told me, she hopes, her yearly ½ diopter increase, keeps going,
She would like -15.00 glasses, with lots of rings, she loves the looks of strong glasses.
I have to admit, that they look very nice.
When we were leaving for the Christmas break, Sandy told me, she is due for an eye exam, and will have new glasses, when we see each other again.</p>
<p>Like Sandy said, she was wearing new glasses, when I saw her again.
She told me, she had a ¾ diopter increase, in her prescription, and I think her new glasses, look so nice.
When she tried to show me the difference, between her old and new glasses, I put on her old glasses.
This was the first time, I had tried her glasses, looking through lenses that strong, gave me a very exciting feeling.
I looked in the mirror, and could see the rings in the lenses, and how small my eyes now looked.
Sandy, looked at me, pulled me close, and gave me a hug.
Katie, you look so beautiful, wearing strong lenses, I feel like kissing you, and she did.
What a surprise, a girl kissing me, and looking at her, could not help myself, but kissed her back.
Wearing strong glasses and kissing, how exciting, I loved it.
I never, had a boy kissing me, like that, and make me feel as good, as I do now.</p>
<p>Kim phoned me to day, to tell me she had flunked, her vision test, when applying for her drivers license.
She is so happy, she has her vision test, this weekend, and will give me a call, after the test, and when she has her new glasses.</p>
<p>I am now starting to wish, I was myopic.
When I mentioned it to Sandy, she suggested, for me to take my prescription to the college lab, and ask them to make a pair of glasses for me, with my present astigmatism correction with a -1.25 lens, instead of the +1/2, that might make help me, to become myopic, I am young enough.
So when the glasses were made up, and I started to wear them, was surprised how well I could see.
I loved the look of the myopic lenses, and soon could see so well, I had wished I had asked for a stronger prescription.</p>
<p>After the weekend break, Sandy handed me a few glasses cases, these are my old glasses, have fun.
I sure did, I loved trying all the frames, with the stronger lenses.
Sandy, enjoyed it as much, as I did, she loved it, and every once and a while, had to give me a hug and a kiss, and say, that s my girl.
Not long after, I was wearing -3.00 glasses, and seeing very well.</p>
<p>Spring break, is here, when we go back, we will be in our last semester.
My mother, after hearing so much, about Sandy, invited her to come home with me.
When we got home, Sandy was well received.
Kim walked around, proudly showing her, -1.50 myopic, glasses, she looks fantastic., and spend quite a bit of time with us.
She noticed that I was wearing myopic lenses now, and wanted to know all about it.</p>
<p>Sandy, and I were going, to share, my double bed.
I had seen Sandy, without clothes before, when she came out of the shower.
She has lovely breasts, medium, size, and a slim waistline.
I am a little heavier, in the bust, and not as slim in the waist.
This is the first time, I share a bed with her.
We both climbed, into bed, and the first thing Sandy did, was to say, I will have to kiss you good night now.
While we were having a kiss, her hands started stroke my body, and that was the start, of me finding out, what lesbian sex was like.</p>
<p>We are back, at college now, and I realize, I love Sandy, as much as she loves me, and we are going to make sure, that after graduating, and getting jobs, so we can live together.
We were very fortunate, we both ended up, with a job, in the same town, Sandy working at the optical store in the mall, and I have a job, at an optical clinic, assisting two optometrists, and dispensing glasses
After graduating, we rented an apartment
Kim, realizing, about Sandy and I, managed to make my parents understand, my choice of a sexual partner.
They liked Sandy, and we were welcome to come home, whenever we wanted.
Sandy s parents , accepted us, and made us welcome.
Lying in bed, the other night thinking, I realize, that it all started, when Jennifer went
for her eye exam.</p>
