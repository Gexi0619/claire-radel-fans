        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>I really hate this job. Life hasn’t been what I thought it would, I’ve tried in so many ways to become the person I want to be, but it seems impossible.
 A few years ago, I got a job at a public office, even if I was studying to become an Engineer and the position was for a secretary, the job was everything a student would’ve wanted.   My name is Camden, but no one calls me that, everyone refers to me as Cammie. I’m 26 years old and I’ve been… well was in a romantic relationship for 6 years with another girl, her name is Danielle.   Danielle was a very cool partner, she is a journalist, and she is the kind of person who everyone loves to have around. The only problem for me, was that she absolutely hates her glasses. Is not that she needs them really bad, her prescription is about -1.5 each eye, but she refuses to wear them.</p>
<p>For me glasses always have been something to be fascinated about, but you’ll hear about that latter.  </p>
<p>6 years might seem easy but to be honest, even if times haven’t been as rough as they could be, we’re not in the same place anymore. I will always love her, but we just don’t match now.   Last night we had the most awful fight, jealousy has taking a tool on her. She came home and I was having diner with my best friend Leo. Let me explain why she is jealous with Leo… He is my absolute best friend, we’ve known each other for 13 years now, we met in elementary school. Leo is a very particular guy, he is a musician, but he makes weird music. He is the person that has made me laugh the most, he is also the person who knows me the most. Leo has had a rough life, he was born with congenital cataracts and somehow he developed glaucoma. When I met him, he wore very very thick sport googles and I could see his big eyes through them, I was very curious about his glasses, so I sat with him and asked him EVERYTHING about them, ever since that day we became inseparable friends. On 6th year, Leo was the class clown, but he wasn’t liked by everyone, so one day a bunch of guys threw a soccer ball at him and everything went wrong. Leo started screaming and saying he couldn’t see, I ran towards him and I felt so angry I stood up and started punching everyone in my way. Leo was taken to the hospital and two weeks later after two surgeries, and a lot of praying it was confirmed: Leo had lost his sight on his right eye. (His retina detached)That only brought us closer, his left eye sees what it cans, but it isn’t that much.</p>
<p>When I got my drivings license, I became Leos official driver. Everywhere he wanted to go I took him, even when he wanted to go to very crowded or low light places, he grabbed my shoulder and I guided him. I saw Leos heart break a lot of times, girls never wanted to be seen with “the blind guy”. One day I picked him up as usual and we went to the same Starbucks we have gone for years. I felt Leo a little weird, he was nervous and making awful jokes, saying he was ugly and he knew and to tell you the truth, he isn’t ugly, he is tall, fit, he has curly blond hair… The only thing that made him look weird is that he only wore sports googles, I think a pair of adult glasses would’ve suit him better, but that was his choice.  I ordered my Chai latte as usual, he got his Chip coffee with tons of sugar, and we went to the smokers area. He has never been a smoker but I am, so we were enjoying each others company and I was telling him about a girl I liked when he confessed his feelings for me. I was surprised, Leo knew I’m not into boys, well, not that much, specially when they become like family.   I hugged him and told him I was gonna be with him for the rest of our lives, but as his best friend, he said he was thankful and he reached his hand for me to take it. I knew his eyesight was a lot worse right now, he wouldn’t admit it, but I figured it out cause he didn’t text me much, he sent what’sApp audios instead, and said he preferred if I did too, he also held my shoulder everywhere now.
  Leo has been in love with me ever since that day, I know he is, but I can’t love him back. I never spoke about this part with Dannie cause I knew she wasn’t gonna be cool about it, but she always said “Leo is so in love with you I get angry just by looking at you guys together”. But I didn’t care, boys and girls come and go but friendship is forever. I did try to be away from Leo when Dannie was with us though.</p>
<p>Well I got lost, I was telling you about our fight last night, I took Leo to his weekly appointment to the ophthalmologist. The doctor said Leos eye pressure should be checked weekly and his family and me followed every advice the eye doctor gave us. So his mom called me and said she wasn’t gonna be able to take Leo to the eye doctor and asked if I could. “Of course” I said, and went to pick Leo up.   When he left he was sad, his eye pressure was still very high and the doctor wasn’t happy about it. So I tried to make him forget about that by buying his favorite Chinese food. We went to my place and that’s when Dannie came.  She got mad, she yelled at me and said “When you get tired of being a guide dog, come up”. I got so so angry, I drove Leo to his house and came to end things up with Danielle.   We fought for hours and she ended up begging me to stay with her but I couldn’t, I grabbed a suitcase and packed everything I could fit in it, and I went to my car. I didn’t know where to go, my parents were still a little mad about me being with a girl, my brother already had a family and my sister in law was a very special lady, so I ran with the family I had the nearest: Leo.</p>
<p>  Leo’s Mom, Mrs. Miller opened the door and hugged me tight, I lost it and I cried hard she then said she always had a room in her house for me and took my things inside. I asked where Leo was and she said he was taking a shower but I could wait in his room if I wanted to, so I went upstairs to wait for Leo. I turned his old PS2 on (tbh he couldn’t see that much so the only one using it was me).  My jaw dropped when I saw Leo coming out from the bathroom. He had his towel tied to his waist only covering his lower area, but I wasn’t ready to how his upper body was now. You could see every muscle well defined, I guess being trapped in a house with a gym had it’s benefits.   He came wearing his glasses as usual, but I could see how wet they were, I guess he took his shower with them on.  </p>
<p>I said “wow Leo, when did you get in such good shape”  </p>
<p>“FUCK Cammie, you scared the shit out of me. At least turn the volume on so I know you’re here” Leo said  </p>
<p>“Hey Leo, I’m really sorry for how Danielle treated you, you are my very best friend and I ended things with her”</p>
<p>  “Thanks Cammie but you shouldn’t have done that. Danielle is right, I’ve been a pain in the ass, you should be out with your other friends, not guiding me like a dog” said Leo</p>
<p>  “What the heck are you talking about Leo? We are together through everything, remember? I don’t want you to say those things again.  I enjoy spending my time with you, If I didn’t I would be honest”  </p>
<p>“Oh shit, these are drying out already, let me clean them or they will be stained all day long” said Leo, he then proceeded to take his glasses of and brought them down to rub them with his towel. I was fascinated by this sight. His eyes were lost, they kept moving around, I could see his right eye being completely blue. I’m sure he only saw light when he took his glasses off. He rubbed a little too hard cause his towel fell to the floor. Since my eyes were all over him, I got a glance of his entire body…
OH MY GOD. I felt so aroused I had to excuse myself and went out for a smoke.   “What is this?” I Thought “’m not supposed to be aroused by Leo, he is like my brother… but not even after smoking I stopped thinking about him. It was late already, so I went to the room Mrs. Miller had set for me. I was alone and my fingers had to rub my clit for a few minutes before I could fall sleep. (By a few minutes, I do mean like 3 minutes… Leo was still in my head)   </p>
<p>Next morning started with Leo coming to “my” room yelling “I brought you some coffee beast, soon you’ll be the beauty again”</p>
<p>  “hahaha shut up idiot, I’m always the beauty” I said  </p>
<p>“I know you are Camm, but here I made you some coffee”</p>
<p>  Everything Leo did for me was extra special because he didn’t admit it but he wasn’t seeing that much these days, even with his strong magnifying glasses on.</p>
<p>   My day went as usual, but I was amazed I never thought of Danielle, instead I kept thinking about Leo and the towel incident. I was in fact desperate to get out of work and run to Mrs. Miller house.</p>
<p>  “Leo? I’m home” I screamed  </p>
<p>“I’m working out” was his response  </p>
<p>I left my purse on the couch and ran to the gym on the third floor. There he was, the same Leo I saw yesterday, but now he had his curly hair tied on a pony tail and his shirtless body exposed his well formed chest and his six pack.</p>
<p>  “Hey beauty, now you don’t look so grumpy anymore” he said</p>
<p>  “Ha-Ha I’m never grumpy, I’m lovely and you know it” I said jokingly</p>
<p>  “You truly are, I’m lucky to have you as my bestie” He told me, “Camm, could I please ask you for a favor?&quot;</p>
<p>  “Of course, you know you can ask me anything” This time I meant it  </p>
<p>“Do you think you can drive me to Starbucks today?” he said</p>
<p>  “Sure, do you want to hang out there?” I asked  </p>
<p>“Not exactly, I have a date.”   he said</p>
<p>My heart sunk, I’m selfish and I never thought he was gonna get over me, not at least now that I was into him.</p>
<p>  “Of course Leo, I’m so glad” I said trying to hide the fact that I was a bit jealous</p>
<p> “Thanks, I’ll be ready in about 20 minutes okay? he said </p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll wait playing PS2” I replied and   I have to say I’m a little bit happy cause he got his date, but at the same time I’m confused  .</p>
<p>Leo came back from the shower again, and once more and I offered him to clean his glasses cause I knew he had trouble seeing to clean them, he gave them to me and I held them in my hands more than I should only cause the sight of him literally groping for the hair gel and then the face cream made me so horny, I really felt so aroused. It was more than obvious he was almost blind…</p>
<p>   “Jeez Camm you only needed to dry them, no need to polish them&quot; He said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohhh sorry Leo, I just wanted to clean them good&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Cammie, can I have them back please?&rdquo; He said with a tone of desperation</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure, here&rdquo; I said and soon realized he had no idea where my hand was cause his arm started to move from left to right till he touched me</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, now, I&rsquo;m ready&rdquo; Said Leo</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait honey, your shirt is backwards” I said  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ohh fuck, thanks” He replied as he took the shirt off and I could see by this point he was guessing where the label was</p>
<p>“let me help, is this way” his face was bright red.</p>
<p>  I drove him to Starbucks and he asked me to help him select a table, I did and he then asked if I would please bring two cups of coffee with me. This was going too far, I was ok with helping him, but I felt bad and couldn’t help it.</p>
<p>  I ordered two Chip coffees and said “Here Leo, call me when you are done”   </p>
<p>“Wait, why don’t you seat with me” Leo said  </p>
<p>“I don’t think it would be nice to have a girl on your table when your date comes in” I said</p>
<p>  “Well, what if I told you you are my date?” He said smiling at me  I felt such joy I can’t describe</p>
<p>“What?” I said   </p>
<p>“Yeah, even for a blind dude the way you looked a me was pretty obvious the other day. Don’t tell me you didn’t like what you saw” He said</p>
<p>  “Wait a minute, you saw me?</p>
<p>“What?” he interrupted “You thought I was completely blind? No Camm, out of my left eye I can still see a little bit and maybe I couldn’t see your eyes looking at me but I took a wild guess and now you&rsquo;re totally busted”</p>
<p>  Damn, I’ve fallen into his trap, he caught me and now I had to admit my feelings</p>
<p>  “Ok Leo, I have to admit I liked what I saw the other day” I said, “but I think I’m a lesbian, how could I feel attracted to you?”</p>
<p>  Leo responded very wisely
“Why do you have to label yourself? You should fall in love with people, not with genders”</p>
<p>  “Ok Leo, but falling in love is one thing, being attracted is a whole different one” I replied  </p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, that’s why we have a date now. You can walk out any time and I won’t judge you. Our friendship won’t be compromised by this either”   </p>
<p>“Ok” I said as I took a cigarette out and started to talk to him like I wasn’t his best friend, what a surprise that day was. I knew him but I never pictured him being so polite, so interesting in a romantic kind of way.</p>
<p>  We went home together and both of us went to tour respective room like nothing had happened. Next morning, I heard him screaming FUCK downstairs so I ran to see what was going on</p>
<p>  “What’s wrong?” I asked</p>
<p>  “I’ve burnt my hand on this stupid stove, SHIT!!! FUCK!!” He replied</p>
<p>  “Let me see, let me see” I said. He then showed me and to be honest I thought he was over reacting, his hand looked just fine.</p>
<p>  “It’s not the burnt itself what bothers me Camm, I’m angry cause I can’t even cook a fucking egg properly without burning my stupid hand. I’m tired if having this eyes, I’m tired of you having to drive me, of you reading me menus at coffeeshops, of my mom helping me pick out my glasses cause I can’t see enough to pick them by myself. I’m just tired”  </p>
<p>I didn’t know what to say so I kissed him.  
  I felt his tender lips kissing mine as a tear ran through his cheek, what started as a soft cute kiss suddenly became passionate. I felt his tounge searching for mine, as his strong manly hands grabbed my waist.   I grabbed his head, running my hands through his hair, and he started kissing my neck.</p>
<p>  “Do you want to?” He said</p>
<p>  “Leo, don’t stop please, and don’t ask obvious questions” I said.</p>
<p>  His kisses then went from my neck to my boobs, so I took my blouse off for him to reach them better. I could see his left eye trying to see everything he was doing, and it aroused me greatly.  He undid my bra and ran his tongue through my boobs, I then took his shirt off and admired his beautiful body.</p>
<p>  He stopped and said “Camm wait. I need to tell you something. I’ve never been with anybody”</p>
<p>  “Don’t worry Leo, you’re doing it great” I said.</p>
<p>  “Do you mind if we go upstairs?” He asked</p>
<p>  “No, It’s fine, let’s go”</p>
<p>I said grabbing his hand to guide him, there was no need cause he walked behind me and hugged me grabbing my boobs.   </p>
<p>He tied his hair on a pony tail and he looked even better that way, he sat on his bed and I couldn’t help but to see him struggle to find my body. I was about 11 feet away from him and he couldn’t see me.
I took my pants off and left only my g string on. I sat on top of him and kissed him once again. He kissed my breasts again and I had a mix of sensations when the cold lens from his glasses touched my skin, I could see his glasses all smudged and if he had trouble with his clean glasses, imagine now…</p>
<p>  I went down on my knees and took his penis out of his zipper, he said “wait let me get my pants off” and he did it so fast he almost hits me. It’s not like he was doing it on purpose since I was sure he wasn’t seeing me. Now all naked, I sucked him as hard as I could, he kept making noises that had me crazy.
  He got up and leaned me on the bed, then he inserted his penis in my vagina and I felt like I was touching the sky, I turned around to face him and when he came closer to kiss me, I took his glasses off out of an impulse.  He kept moving back and forward hard and I didn’t want him to stop.</p>
<p>His eyes weren’t focusing on anything, not that they could anyways but he knew it and he didn’t even try.</p>
<p>He came just as I did, then he tried to go close to me but I had to grab his face and lead it to mine cause it was obvious he was totally blind now, the lack of light in the room didn’t help him either.   </p>
<p>We hugged each other and I fell asleep on his arms, next morning I woke up with him hugging me and I said</p>
<p>“good morning beast”</p>
<p>he responded with “good morning beauty”</p>
<p>I got up and kissed him on the mouth, I put my pants on without putting underwear, and my blouse without my bra, and saw him looking at the wall not seeing anything.</p>
<p>I asked him “What if I make you breakfast this time, and while I’m cooking you can make love to me”</p>
<p>  “I would love that beauty, but my mom is probably downstairs” he said “but if you want to we could take a shower together”</p>
<p>  “Yes, please” I said and I went to the bathroom   </p>
<p>“Uhhh Camm” I heard him scream</p>
<p>  “Yes?” I came back to his room </p>
<p> “Can you please give me my glasses? You took them off and I couldn’t find them earlier” Said Leo</p>
<p>  “Ohhh shit sorry” I said.</p>
<p>  I grabbed his glasses that were on the floor and put them on him, and then kissed him hard again (Thank god sports googles don’t break that easily)</p>
<p>  We took our shower together and I understood why the googles were important: He indeed showered with them.</p>
<p>  “Leo, I’m going to your aunts silvia. Will Cammie take you to the ophthalmologist?” said Mrs. Miller  </p>
<p>“Yes mom, she will” said Leo</p>
<p>  Mrs. Miller went out and we made love again and again and again… Once in the shower, another time on her bed, one more time on the couch.      </p>
<p>Years went by…</p>
<p>  Leo and I have been together ever since that day, I love to guide him through crowds, I love to help him choosing his clothes. He loves to kiss me while I play PS2 (He can’t see enough to play with me, but sometimes he tries and I help him). Now we’re getting married and we’re gonna be parents soon. Leo is worried our son will have the same issues he does but the doctor told us that even though is possible, is not probable.  His mom unfortunately passed away last month and that only brought us closer.   My best friend turned out to be my soulmate and I wouldn’t change it for the world.   </p>
<p>PS. Malina this one is for you. I hope you enjoy this story!</p>
