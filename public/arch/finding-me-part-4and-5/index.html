          <p>4Â 
Â I must get home Annabelle will be arriving in about a hour
As soon as I started to think about Annabelle my body started shaking ,I had never smoked outside,but now was the time to forget all my inhibitions. I needed a cigarette,but I had not brought any with me.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m a regular smoker I think I must buy myself a nice silver case.
I remembered Â waiting outside this tobacco shop when my husband used to buy his cigarettes. I always refused to go in with him.
My husband was always looking at girls wearing glasses and smoking and suggesting I should start smoking. I was adamant I would never put one between my lips.</p>
<p>I nervously opened the door.</p>
<p>A young lady peered at me from the other side of the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have 100 marlboro reds please and a lighter please&rdquo; I Stuttered&quot; To the young lady .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes madam,I have not seen you in here before&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only recently started smoking,in fact I only tried my very first cigarette a few days ago&rdquo;
âI used to stand outside waiting while my husband came in here and bought his cigarettes,ever since we got married he kept pestering me to smoke, like his first wife did but I hated the idea, I would never let him put a cigarette in my mouth,even just to take a photo, we argued a lot about it â</p>
<p>âYou might have seen me standing outside waiting for himâ</p>
<p>âNo I&rsquo;m sorry madam my eyesight is much too bad to see anybody outside,its very difficult for me to even see across to the other side of the shopâ</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you wants reds madam,if you only been smoking a few days, they are very strong for a beginner&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I know. But something happened last week and I was desperate to please my husband,so I found his cigarette,it was such a horrible feeling holding the cigarette between my lips,I was terrified I had never even touched a cigarette before,I really didn&rsquo;t know how to smokeâ
âI looked in the mirror,I did not like what I saw was that really me with THAT cigarette hanging out of my mouth,it was something I had sworn I would never do,I used 3 marches before I got it to light all the while looking in the mirrors at myself with disgust,I coughed and coughed but I was desperate to please him,and hour later I tried a second, again forcing myself to look in the mirror at Â that person smoking Â after the 3rd one I was sick a lot but I felt a little light headed and not as stressed&rdquo;</p>
<p>âSo to keep calm I smoke a lot now,I still can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s me smoking.When I look in the mirror,I hate what I see â</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I understand,I know that stressful feeling myself; I&rsquo;m a very heavy smoker&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried using one of these cigarette holder,you don&rsquo;t have to hold the cigarette with your lips then &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,what is it likeâ</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry but Â I can&rsquo;t really see it, my eyesight is very bad.I only got these new glasses two days ago,I also got a new separate pair for seeing close, I see double if I&rsquo;m looking at close things with these glasses,So my reading glasses have a black film over the right lens then I only see out of my left eye, but I&rsquo;m rather shy about being seen wearing them out of the house&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a problem Madam I will drop the lock on the door for 10mins&rdquo;
&ldquo;There that ok would you like me to hold your cane and your glasses while you put your reading glasses on,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please, be careful with them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the frames.There is nothing to be shy about,you look pretty wearing them&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is happening,first Annabelle Says I have sexy eyes now this lady says I look pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The holders are very nice,there are so many different colours and lengths,I would no know what to choose&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest this one it&rsquo;s about 4,ins long it&rsquo;s the best length to start with and maybe red,It will show you are a confident smoker&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me a confined smoker ha.
I&rsquo;m horrified and disgusted with myself everytime I put a cigarette between my lips.,but it helps me stay calm,so I have to keep lighting one,then another soon the packet is empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to have a coffee and a smoke,would you like to join me ,I always Â smoke in the back room, here is your cane I have your other glasses safe in my hands,don&rsquo;t be shy about your reading glasses they look nice*</p>
<p>*Thank you that&rsquo;s so kind of you&rdquo;</p>
<p>She just said I look nice wearing these glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here let me put a cigarette in the holder for you.
Shall I light it for you,you will need to suck a little harder using a holderÂ 
There that looks more sexy that just a cigarette in your mouth&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked in the mirror, I had to admit to myself ,that I looked more elegant with the holder in my mouth than just a horrible cigarette hanging from my lips</p>
<p>âThank you I needed that,I think I&rsquo;m addicted already&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had heard that word sexy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your glasses are very unusual I hope you don&rsquo;t mind me asking you about them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it&rsquo;s fine a have worn glasses since I was about 3 years old, as you can tell by the thickness of my lens I&rsquo;m nearly blind,next time I come in I will tell you all about it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need glasses really,it&rsquo;s very difficult.to see working in the shop I only have one good eye if I close by right eye I can&rsquo;t see anything out of my left eye, but my boyfriend hates glasses,and won&rsquo;t let me go for an eye test&rdquo;Â 
&ldquo;He says I will look ugly wearing glasses,So we can&rsquo;t even talk about my eyes,everytime he sees a girl wearing glasses he says I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t need those things&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the coffee and the cigarette, the mouth spay was nice as well,I must go now I have a Â special friend due soon&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I help you with your glasses&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please, could you put my reading glasses back in the case for me&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look very different! Would I have to wear glasses like that. I do like the frames&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,Maybe one day you could come with me to my eye Doctor and have your eyes tested we don&rsquo;t need to tell your boyfriend&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please that would be nice, I could just wear them in the shop,he is a non smoker so he never comes in here&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m very careful could I try your glasses on,before you go,I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m nearly blind in my left eye it would be nice to know if glasses would help&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes if you want to but I sure the lens will be much to powerful for you &quot;</p>
<p>*I&rsquo;m so excited,will you put them on for me&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hands were shaking as I put them on for her. Her breath smelt Â clean and warm no horrible smell, like when my husband had been smoking, Ireally wanted to kiss her,Â </p>
<p>&ldquo;O,O my *** I can see you so clearly ,everything is bright and sharp I can even read the sign on the other side of the shop,,they are very heavy but that doesn&rsquo;t matter I love them,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see out of my right eye,,but I can see so clear out of my left eye ,I can&rsquo;t remember seeing like this before.This eye has always been useless&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow I can even read all the display cabinets over there and you look so much clearer&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could keep them, when can I see your friend and get my eyes tested&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels nice Me wearing these glasses and you wearing yours, there is a mirror over there can we look at each other&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is it I can smell her perfume so much I have never noticed those smells before and my heart racing&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have put another cigarette in the holder you can put it in the corner of you mouth Â then you won&rsquo;t need to hold it and I will light it for you when you get outside&rdquo;
&ldquo;Here is your cane, I have put a blue cigarette holder in your bag as well it&rsquo;s a present from me&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I keep your glasses on and walk to the bus stop with you&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we got outside she took me by the arm and gave me a gentle kiss on my cheeks.</p>
<p>We started waking down the street taking long drags of our cigarettes though the bright red holders.</p>
<p>When we got to the bus stop she took the glasses off and put them in the case for me</p>
<p>&ldquo;O it&rsquo;s strange without the glasses on, everything is so blurred again, when can you arrange to get my eyes tested&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the bus was arriving she pushed something into my hand,and gave me another kiss this time on the lips</p>
<p>BYE BYE we both said.</p>
<p>I FELT MORE CONFIDENT.</p>
<p>I LIKED THE NEW ME.</p>
<p>To be continuedÂ </p>
<p>Part 5</p>
<p>The babysitter was waiting for me when I got home.
I quickly changed and put new makeup on.</p>
<p>I had sent a message to Annabelle and told her I would be a little late,and could I bring a lady that I had meet for an eye test some time.</p>
<p>The door light flashed,they were here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my sister Judy, she will take Linda to the park&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we look very much alike,her eyesight is not as bad as mine YET But it&rsquo;s much worse than mine was at her age,she was 18 last month&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Judy had gone,i started to feel hot,</p>
<p>We both just stood looking at each other.
Was yesterday just a big mistake?.</p>
<p>I then started shaking, Annabelle came towards me,she hugged me and we both started crying.</p>
<p>I instantly knew yesterday was real.</p>
<p>Annabelle said&quot;I think we should sit down and talk about things and how we both feel&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get us a drink, would your like ,coffee tea or wine&rdquo;
Â  Â Â 
&ldquo;Yes please you choose,</p>
<p>I picked up my cane and went into the kitchen and found 2 glasses and a bottle of sparkling wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annabelle smiled I think we have something to celebrate,I hope you agree&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a confession to make after I got your message saying that you had left your reading glasses behind. I went straight back into the lounge to find them.
As soon as I got into bed I took them out of the case and put them on the bedside table next to me. It felt as if you were in bed with me, the thick lens were sparkling as if they were calling out to me,YOU HAVE TO PUT US ON.
I couldn&rsquo;t resist it Â THE FEELING WAS WONDERFUL, Annabelle was with me.</p>
<p>When I woke this morning I was still wearing them&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabelle looked happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;WOW if it confession time I have something to tell you Â ha &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rushed out so fast when my father arrive yesterday I did not have time to give you your hearing aid back&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was missing you such a lot when I got back home,so I got some double sided sticky tape and pulled my hair apart and stuck the button to my head and hooked the aid over my ear,that way you were still with be while I slept I love the feeling of it over my ear,</p>
<p>I always wondered what it was like to wear hearing aids &quot;</p>
<p>She pulled her hair up. &ldquo;You had better have it back now&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the button and the aid were now beautifully decorated with reds and yellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really want to know what it feels like to WEAR hearing aids ALL THE TIME Â and and only hear through them.I still have the last pair I wore before I had an implant&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;REALLY, And they would work ,I would only hear through them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes they have thick silicone moulds that go deep into your ears Â so if the aids are turned off you would be profoundly Deaf&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does profoundly Deaf mean&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means you not hear any sounds or voices until you turn them on&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what it&rsquo;s like for you without your aids in&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YES&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PLEASE CAN I TRY THEM ON I&rsquo;m all excited now</p>
<p>,&ldquo;I will find them after we had our drinks,they will need new batteries and I will sterilize the Moulds&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you really want to wear them all the time then we need to get you your own moulds&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both got the giggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see my new reading glasses that I made this morning&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes please&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister tested my eyes this morning as it had been a year since I had the glasses that I left behind&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was was very surprised when my sister showed me the new prescription*</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prescription for my left eye had only increased a little Â it was now plus ,46 and still no astigmatism BUT my right eye was now 49.75 and I now had developed a large amount of astigmatism I needed 5.75 of correction for Â that eye&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did think I should use a thinner 1.75 lens this time Â but we did not have them in stock so used the C39 lens like I normally do,but with the extra plus 4 diopters and the 5.75 of astigmatism my right lens is EVEN thicker and very different to my left lens. My eye will look very different I hope you not upset about it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please can I see them and may I put them on for you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait I need my own reading glasses haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frames were large and black,I loved the contrast to her bright red lipstick&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could see what Annabelle meant ,the left lens was very thick, but did not seem very different to her older reading glasses,but her right lens was huge,it must have been over 2 Ins thick in the middle.</p>
<p>I slowly remove her distance glasses. The addrillion was rushing through my.body as I placed the new glasses on her.</p>
<p>I had loved seeing her beautiful big eyes Â behind the thick lens of her old reading glasses,</p>
<p>But with these bigger frames on,Her eyes looked so different to each other, the left eye was very big as before,but her right eye was enormous. The whole of her bright.blue pupil filled the entire lens. I could not see any white of her eyes.</p>
<p>I grabbed hold of her and frantically started kissing her I blurted out &ldquo;I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU &quot;</p>
<p>I suddenly stopped WHAT HAD I JUST SAID SHE&rsquo;S A WOMAN,</p>
<p>I went bright red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I pour the wine,I think we have something to celebrate,&ldquo;Annabelle said.</p>
<p>*Can I try another cigarette.I liked smoking yesterday,and Â I&rsquo;m SURE Â YOU need one as well ha &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please,I&rsquo;m sorry Â for what I said it just slipped out&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok I LOVE YOU AS WELL,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got these cigarette holders today when I bought some more cigarettes&rdquo;
&ldquo;You have the red one it matches your red lipstick&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow they look sexy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what to do ha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I think so you light it and I suck in slowly Haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just leave the holder in your mouth and slowly inhale then wait before exhaling out of your nose and feel the warm smoke in your mouth and nose&rdquo;</p>
<p>,&ldquo;O Annabelle your hands are so soft and warm&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>When we woke Anabelle smiled at me &ldquo;Can I have another cigarette please,I enjoyed last one and I did not coughing as much ha,&rdquo;
&ldquo;I love the sexy red holder,I hope you feel as happy as I do&rdquo;</p>
<p>I handed Annabell my silver cigarette case.</p>
<p>*The case is beautiful ,I think I will buy one to put in my handbag it will look nicer than a packet of cigarettes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you are going to start smoking regularly and carry cigarettes with you,what about your father if he sees them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter about him,I loved the cigarette,it made me feel more relaxed&rdquo;
&ldquo;I want to buy my own cigarettes&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can smoke as often as I want to,I think it will make me feel more confident&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want people look at me smoking and my red cigarette holder instead of just my thick glasses and cane&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to stay the night&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your sister could take Linda home with her that would be nice and we could have a some time together then we could Â collect her in the morning&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;,Yes that would be lovely,but what about your husband,when will he be home&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be coming home he is having an affair with his secretary,they are flying to America in a few days time&rdquo;
&ldquo;I meet her today haha I will tell you all about it later haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are getting a divorce&rdquo;
&ldquo;I will be a free woman&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabelle looked shocked,she was still holding the cigarette holder in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should light your cigarette now Annabelle, You look as if you need it hahaha</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go and find the hearing aids for you,can your decorate my other cochlear aid for me please&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found my last pair of hearing aids put the mounds in to soak my old hearing</p>
<p>While Anabelle was decorating them I made us a snack and found another bottle of sparkling wine</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the evening hugging and kissing each other
We had both had Too much to drink</p>
<p>Â &ldquo;I think we should go to bed now</p>
<p>Annabelle smiled.</p>
<p>( The next part is a bit different , thought I add it for a change )
Â </p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go and get a fresh towel out for you then you can shower first&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok I Will come with you,and you can show me we&rsquo;re everything bid kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bathroom is lovely it&rsquo;s all so tidy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re do your keep the the tablets and little pot to soak your dentures in overnight&rdquo;</p>
<p>I WENT BRIGHT RED. How did she know I wore dentures ,had they moved. When we&rsquo;re were kissing or did she feel them when she had her tongue in my mouthÂ </p>
<p>&ldquo;WHAT DO YOU MEAN&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Don&rsquo;t you soak them overnight when you are sleeping&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO I DON&rsquo;T&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry if I upset you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just take them out when I&rsquo;m on my own and clean them and put them straight back in nobody except my dentist has seen me without them, I have never had the courage to look at myself in the mirror&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I DON&rsquo;T want to talk about i</p>
<p>&ldquo;ITS TO IMBARSERING&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you not know what you look like with no teeth that&rsquo;s sad you will look a little different but just as pretty and sexyâ
Annabelle smiled &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get upset look at me&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slowly put her hand in her mouth and held her top teeth.
I gasped as they came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wear false teeth as well&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had said AS WELL, Â 
I had admitted I wore DENTURES&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I had all my teeth out last year, Will you take my bottoms out now for me&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was shaking I was now holding both of her dentures in my hand</p>
<p>Anabelle smiled at me.&ldquo;Do you still love me without my teeth in&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;,YES OF COURSE I DO&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here then, look at my big eye&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHAT ARE YOU DOING&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly I felt the denture glue give way on my top plate,as Annabell removed my top denture next she gently took the bottom ones out,I was so embarrassed,what must I look like I instantly covered my mouth with my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a glass to put our dentures in.
One glass will be ok if we&rsquo;re going to sleep together then our false teeth can share the same glass tonight haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabelle hugged me and held my hand slowly moving it away from my mouth,we started kissing each other ,the next minute my heart was pounding with excitement as I felt her tongue on the roof of my mouth.
When she kissed me like that before I had felt nothing.
Now I realised why she knew that I wore dentures,her tongue must have felt all the hard plastic in my mouth instead of my soft skin</p>
<p>Â When we got into bed Annabelle suggested that tomorrow we both get our hair cut short,as it seemed a shame to hide our hearing aids as they looked so beautiful now.</p>
<p>We both still had our reading glasses on, Annabell said let&rsquo;s change glasses,we don&rsquo;t need to see anything ,we have our hands..</p>
<p>I woke first I still had Annabelle&rsquo;s glasses on,I found my distance glasses and put them on and went into the kitchen and make a coffee for us both, I was just going to take it into Annabelle when she appears at the doorway she smiled at me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drink your coffee to hot &ldquo;she said
&ldquo;Remember you have not got your dentures in you might burn your mouth you have no plastic in your mouth to protect it&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to admit the Coffee tastes nicer.</p>
<p>Anabelle had brought the cigarettes and our holders with her, she put cigarettes in both our holders, placed them in her mouth and lit them,she took a long drag on them before handing me one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nice,such a different taste without my false teeth in*</p>
<p>I took several long drags on mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes your a right much nicer,and the Coffee has more flavour&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabell Â gave me a gummy smile,&ldquo;I only wear mine when I&rsquo;m working or going out some place&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t wear them all the time&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha Â I only put them in just as I&rsquo;m going to work,then as soon as I&rsquo;m home I take them out&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I don&rsquo;t think I could do that,I have never seen what I look without them in, I had all my teeth out when I was 18 and had these dentures put in straight away, I have had these for 12 years that&rsquo;s why I need to use so much denture glue to hold them in</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we get ready and go and get our hairs cut&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes that would be good&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to do your makeup for you,then can you put the hearing aids in for me and show me how they work&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I put my teeth back in,it hard to talk without them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok but not until after I have done your makeup&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There that&rsquo;s nearly done I have given your cheeks a bit more colour and a lot more eye makeup It make your eyes look bigger&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,could you put some of your bright red lipstick on I liked the taste haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your glasses on and watch how I do mine&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All done can your show me how the hearing aids work and will you put them in for me , I&rsquo;m all excited&rdquo;</p>
<p>I explained how to put the batteries in and how the volume controls worked,and warned Annabell that she would not be able to hear anything when the moulds were in until I turned the aids on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready now I will put the right side mould in first then hook the aid over your ear, how does that feel&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow my ear feels blocked and I can&rsquo;t hear anything out of it,but I love feeling of the aid over my ear,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to fit the other mould in now, remember you won&rsquo;t be able to hear anything till I turn them on.hold your hand up when you feel ready for me to turn them on&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I CANT HEAR ANYTHING ,IM TALKING BUT I CAN&rsquo;T HEAR WHAT IM SAYINGS,EVEN IF I TALK Â L O U D, IS THIS HOW YOU ARE WITH YOUR AIDS IN&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smiled and nodded&rdquo;</p>
<p>I watched Annabelle face as I turned first the right aid on.
&ldquo;Wow I can hear again but everything sounds different, I can only just hear the radio,can you turn it up please*</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that better they are on number 3, will turn one off at a time then put your hand up if it&rsquo;s ok&rdquo;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good Now I will do the same with the other*
&ldquo;Annabelle shuck her head,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the wireless so quiet now&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the aid it was on on number 3 as the other Aid.
So I turned it up number 4 then 5, Â Annable indicatedÂ 
Up Â more, when I reach 6 Annabell smiled&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better just a little more,stop that perfect,what is wrong with that hearing aid&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothings wrong with the aid, Its your hearing that is the problem.
&ldquo;You probably have s 80% hearing loss in that ear&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I&rsquo;m DEAF and I REALLY need to wear a hearing aid in that ear, wow O my ***&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well actually your hearing is not perfect in left ear as well, SO you should be wearing 2 hearing aid all the time&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s a BIG SHOCK I thought it would be fun just to try them,and know what it was like,I never thought I would need them&rdquo;
&ldquo;I need a cigarette,will you light it for me please&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was holding my hand tightly .
The cigarette was glowing bright red as she took long heavy drags from it.The holder was hanging from the corner of her mouth,she seemed not to have time to exhale,just one long drag after another.</p>
<p>,&ldquo;Are you upset about needing to wear them all the time now and not just for FUN&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO it just came as a BIG SHOCk.We will be even more like each other now. that&rsquo;s nice. And I don&rsquo;t need to pretend that I need them haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>*We had better go now or we will miss the bus&rdquo;</p>
<p>Home now</p>
<p>Had a wonderful day with Annabell</p>
<p>Went to the hairdresser first, had our hair cut short, Annabell suggested we had the hair shaved around our ears so it would not hide the lovely colour on our hearing aids and had red highlights added.i also had 2 small circles shaved on both side were the buttons attached to the magnets for my cochlear aids.</p>
<p>The hairdresser lady watched as I put Annabelle&rsquo;s hearing aids back in for her.</p>
<p>Anabelle explained that she had only got them this morning and it was difficult to fit them in so she must practice,this was her first time wearing hearing aids outside,Â 
She told the lady that she had not realised how bad her hearing was until she had got outside this morning I can hear birds singing and the leaves rustling as I walked through the park
The lady thought we looked cool and nice that we weren&rsquo;t hiding our hearing aids.</p>
<p>Next we went to the coffee shop that I took my husband&rsquo;s secretary to, Anabelle laughed when I told her the story and how I had used superglue.We both got the giggles.</p>
<p>The waitress brought us the menu,as if by remote control both our hands dived into our handbags for our reading glasses haÂ 
Annabelle instantly proclaimed how much easier to read it was now with her new reading glasses.I loved looking at her big eyes, especially the right eye I suggest we both keep them on while we eat.</p>
<p>When we had eaten, I ordered coffee.
Annabelle opened her bag and brought out the gold and red cigarette case that she had bought after leaving the hairdressers ,she loaded a cigarette in to her holder and placed it in the corner of her mouth before offering me a cigarette,
I had bought a new holder as well,it was bright red with a gold mouthpiece.</p>
<p>When we got to Anabelle&rsquo;s house Lynda did not seem to have missed me ,the first thing she said was can I stay another night.</p>
<p>Annabell said she Â wanted to test my eyes as she had noticed I was squinting when I was reading the menu.</p>
<p>She sat me down Infront of 2 machine&rsquo;s and studied the printouts.</p>
<p>She had been wearing her reading glasses but now she removed them and placed a pair of strange glasses on instead.
They had what looked like a small pair of binoculars fitted to the lens.she came Very close and shone a bright light into my eyes
She stopped and was just about to say something.</p>
<p>Before she had time.</p>
<p>I grabbed her and started madly kissing her.</p>
<p>The sight of seeing her wearing those strange glasses had been too overpowering. I could not stop myself. I had to kiss her..</p>
<p>I so wanted too put my hand in her mouth and remove her dentures so my tongue could feel her soft mouth and not the hard plastic we both wore.</p>
<p>10 minutes later Â Annabelle removed the strange glasses and put her reading glasses on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have the start of cataracts and in few years time you will Â need to have the lens of your left eye totally removed and and a few years later the lens in your left right eye will need removing as well&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I have my lens removed how will I see&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need special cataract high power magnification lens in your glasses&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure in the future they will find a way to replace your nature lens and transplant either a glass of plastic lens in your eyes</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry about that now let&rsquo;s see if we can sort that squint out&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put the tests frame on me blacked out my left eye and starting trying differnt lens in&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the black bar What number is the red dot on&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not on the bar it in the top corner&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each time she changed the lens the dot Â moved closer to the bar then into the middle,&rdquo;</p>
<p>After about 15 minutes Anabelle said all done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see why my father under prescribed Â you I&rsquo;m sure it was because the glasses you had been wearing were much weaker, and you would have found it difficult to adjust to so much extra power&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s ok with you I will make you a pair with your full prescription in&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can order the blanks now and mark it as urgent the they will arrive in about 2 hours So I can make them up and you can wear them home&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they look any difference to what I&rsquo;m wearing now,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explant it later&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little nervous will you come back home with me please&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to move in with you if your husband is leaving,I have never had a girlfriend before either&rdquo;</p>
<p>,&ldquo;YES PLEASE&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Let&rsquo;s go into the garden and have coffee while we wait for the lens to arrive</em></p>
<p>We sat there drinking our Coffee,I felt relaxed now.</p>
<p>So Annabell started to explain her plan and Â what my prescription was going to be and what the lens would look like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more modern equipment than my father,and learnt new ways of treatment for partially sighted patients like your self&rdquo;</p>
<p>*The sight in your right eye is a lot worse than that in your left eye,but your right eye is healthier and the cataract is less developed&rdquo;
&ldquo;You will have to have the lens in your right eye remove first ,so I&rsquo;m going to protect your left eye more&rdquo;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to increase the power in your right eye,This is the new prescription.</p>
<p>R-45.25 I&rsquo;m leaving the astigmatism correction the same but increasing the prism to 25 out and adding 10 Down as well.
&ldquo;Your left eye I am leaving the prescription the same as now&rdquo;
&ldquo;For reading I will leave the power the same just increase the prism ,and instead of using your left eye Â to read we will cover that eye and not the right eye&rdquo;</p>
<p>*I did not REALLY understand what all that meant so I just nodded and just reached for my cigarette holder&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had just lit our cigarettes when Judy came out of the house.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU DOING ANNABELL YOU KNOW FATHER FORBIDS US TO SMOKE.</p>
<p>*Don&rsquo;t worry father&rsquo;s away for the day and I&rsquo;m going to live with Amber&rdquo;
*Come and sit down&rdquo;
&ldquo;Amber&rsquo;s husband has left her,so I going to keep her company'&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw how you looked at each other the other day are you going to be LESBIAN&rsquo;S&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YES I suppose we are, as soon as Annabell divorce come though we plan to get married*</p>
<p>*Don&rsquo;t tell father yet,or that you seen me smoking&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok but can I have a suck on your cigarette I always wanted Â to try a cigarette&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabelle held the cigarette holder and let her sister grip the holder between her lips.
As the smoke and nicotine filled her mouth and drifted into her lungs she started to cough Violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;YUCK Do Â all cigarettes taste like that&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here have a drink of coffee*Annabelle said to her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I try again&rdquo;</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered I had still hadÂ 
some menthol cigarettes in my bag.
I took one out and put it in the blue holder I used before I got the new red one this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here try this it will taste different and suck in slower&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy Coughed a little and smiled before putting the holder back in her mouth, the smoke drifted out of the corner of her lips she continued to take several more longer drags on her cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;WOW that&rsquo;s so cool I love the menthol taste,I feel all grown up, am I smoking it correctly, do I look sexy like a film star with the cigarette holder in the corner of my mouth haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Like smoking but we must not let father know haha&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I make us some sandwiches and another coffee&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy returned with lunch and informed us that the lens were on their way.</p>
<p>Annabelle finished first &ldquo;I will make a start on your glasses&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy And I were still eating.My top denture seemed to be loose,so it wasn&rsquo;t as easy to eat and Judy seemed to be a very slow eater.</p>
<p>I got my cigarette case out and fitted another stick into the holder,I was just going to Â light it whenJudy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I have another cigarette please,I liked the menthol one best&rdquo;</p>
<p>I handed her the packet and the blue holder.i smiled to myself as with shaky hands she fitted the cigarette into the holder.she watched me light mine,I took a longggg slow drag enjoying the warm Taste before exhaling the smoke out of my nose.
I handed her the lighter,it was nice seeing the excited look on her face as she light a cigarette on her own for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Menthol sweats are my favourite but I like the taste of the menthol from the cigarette better it&rsquo;s warm when I suck it in then I get the cool taste of the menthol after&rdquo;
&ldquo;I think I going Â to start smoking instead of buying sweets,but I will have to hide in the garden&rdquo; haha</p>
<p>I had bought myself a small gold cigarette case to put ten sticks in for beside my bed but I decided to give it to Judy,I filled it with the rest of the menthol cigarettes from the packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O is this for me, I will keep it in my hadbag then father won&rsquo;t see it then thank you&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can I call myself a smoker now* haha</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matches my reading glasses case look&rdquo;</p>
<p>*This is my first pair of reading glasses,I started having a problem reading the small print on the envelopes that the lens blanks come in,and after an hour it was all double&rdquo;
&ldquo;So this morning I made myself these&rdquo;
&ldquo;Would you like to be the first person seeing them on me and you can tell me if they look ok&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gasped, she has chosen large gold gold Harry Potter style frames. There was no thick plastic frame to hide the exstream thickness of the lens.
I remembered as a child having a round goldfish bowl that magnified the fish as they swam about.but instead of fish all I could see was her 2 enormous blue eyes flashing as she talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the same problem as my sister,my right eye is much worse than my left, but also I have Â suddenly developed a very high astigmatism in both eyes&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then I noticed Annabell coming towards use.</p>
<p>Judy looked shocked , How long as Annabell been wearing hearing aids Â I have not noticed them before,were they hiding under her long hair&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No it her first day,they are my old aids, she wanted to try them on to see what it felt like to wear hearing aids ,she then realised how much more she could hear wearing them so I let her keep them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow you mean she&rsquo;s DEAF and will always need to wear them&rdquo;</p>
<p>,&ldquo;Yes,she is nearly totally deaf in her Right ear she has been depending on her Left ear without knowing it&rdquo;</p>
<p>,WOW thats cool,do you have I pair I could try,if Sis needs hearing aids maybe I do as well,my eyes are like hers so maybe my hearing is as well&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabell handed me my new glasses case, I was shocked when I opened it,
They had big red frames,just like hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you like them,I know you always wear the pink and blue NHS frames,but I thought if we were going to be together it be nice if our glasses matched*Â </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes that would be nice&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I should explain why I always wear that type of frame&rdquo;</p>
<p>My husband has always chosen my glasses frames for me,and insisted Â I wear the NHS faded pinky beige colour that I hated wearing at school.</p>
<p>As soon as I left school I bought myself a nice fashionable pair,
After I meet him I noticed he kept looking at an old photo of me when I was 18 and graduating from uni,I thought it was because he was proud of me.</p>
<p>The day we got engaged he took me to the optical shop, and had my eyes tested he insisted he bought me new glasses for my wedding,and would keep them as a surprise for me.</p>
<p>The day arrived. He said that he would give me the new glasses at the church while we were getting married, I did not understand what he meant but I thought it was a lovely idea.</p>
<p>We got to the part in the wedding services where we exchanged rings.</p>
<p>He said &quot; with these glasses and this ring to wear for the rest of your life, I give you all my love&rdquo;
He turned towards me and took my glasses off? Everything was a complete blur.Then he put the new glasses on, suddenly things looked brighter and clearer. I was so happy even though it seemed different if I looked sideways.
As we walked back up the aisle people smiled at me and chatted to each other.
&ldquo;You look beautiful darling just like when you Graduated&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know what he meant,he was not at the graduation, but I thought he meant I looked young and pretty&rdquo;
At the reception many people said how happy I looked ,I said Â *Yes I am he bought me these new glasses and gave them to me with the ring ,and said it&rsquo;s like the wedding ring I always wear this style it&rsquo;s part of my wedding vowels Â he said I look younger&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most people thought it was strange but Â pleased as long as I was happy.</p>
<p>We got back to the hotel to change before going back to the reception then leaving for our honeymoon as Mr and Mrs.
We kissed and cuddled,but I wanted to save myself for tonight in Paris.</p>
<p>When I bought my wedding dress the young lady suggested I wear a wedding diaper,as it wasn&rsquo;t easy Â to go to the toilet in a wedding dress and I bought some spares for traveling,so I went into the bathroom to change as the diaper was now full.
It seemed strange that there was no mirrors on the walls ,</p>
<p>When we got back to the reception everybody was waiting for us and took many photos,our professional photographer had come back to take our going away photos,he asked me to take my glasses off for some photos
But my husband snapped at him that I was virtually blind and always wore these glasses.</p>
<p>We caught the overnight train my husband had booked us a first class apartment,we had wine and snacks brought in, my husband locked the door
.
*Can I look at the wedding photos please dear&quot;I said</p>
<p>My husband handed them to me ,he had kept them in his case.</p>
<p>*What is wrong with the photos why did the photographer give us these blurred pictures can you ring him and complain&rdquo;</p>
<p>My husband smiled.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember darling the optician said you needed reading glasses as well*</p>
<p><em>O yes but I thought he meant just to read very print in the news paper at home</em></p>
<p><em>No dear you will need to change your glasses a lot like for cooking and eating your meal</em></p>
<p><em>I thought only old woman wore them I don&rsquo;t think I will like doing that but I if I have to I expect I will get used to it</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will have to, you know the Doctor said your eyesight is deteriorating faster now&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>I suppose I&rsquo;m going to have to put them on now if i want to see the photos,were did we pack them</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes they are in your new hand bag on the rack&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the one above the mirror&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before my husband had time to answer I jumped up to get them,there was a mirror just under the rack I could not wait to see myself wearing my new glasses,</p>
<p>WHO WAS THAT LOOKING OUT OF THE MIRROR AT ME.
WHAT WERE THOSE SMALL CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LENSÂ 
Was that why I couldn&rsquo;t see to the side.
I moved closer .
THE FRAMES WERE THE Â DREADFUL PINKY COLOURED NHS GLASSES that I had worn as s child and when I GRADUATED.</p>
<p>My husband smiled at me &ldquo;I hope you like them dear you look beautiful,do you remember how much I like your graduation photo&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gasped &ldquo;where are my reading glasses&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grabbed the case and opened it.Inside were my reading classes in case were a pair of small round Â pale blue NHS glasses with temple hooks like the pair I wore on my first day at school.
I quickly put them on everything in the photos looked clear nowÂ 
And yes to my horror I was wearing those pink NHS glasses in all the wedding photos</p>
<p>I felt faint.
All things and voices were rushing around in me head all I could hear was myself saying my wedding vowls
(I will wear these glasses and ring for the rest of my life as a token of my love for you)
He tried to push a cigarette between my tightly closed lips,so he light his own cigarette and blew smoke in my face and made me cough violently
Â 
THAT&rsquo;S HOW IT ALL STARTED</p>
<p>*O POOR YOU&rdquo;</p>
<p>Â  &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try these BEAUTIFUL RED frames on you,the lens will be much thicker and I have mounted both lens forward so you can wear false eyelashes like I doÂ 
&ldquo;I know the right lens is very thick but so is mine,I hope that is ok&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes of course if you like them so do I,the colour is fabulous&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you are happy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your new reading glasses Â are still the blue NHS style with cable temple&rsquo;s I Â thought you liked that so that why I choose them,sorry it was before you told me why you wore them&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind looking at me wearing them in bed it&rsquo;s ok with me&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like me to make myself a pair of NHS glasses with cable temples for when we are in bed together,you choose the colour&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;YES please I think blue as well please&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok,but first I will explain your new reading glasses,I Â want to protect your left eye as much as we can, because it&rsquo;s the right eye that we will have to remove the lens from first.
&ldquo;So instead of the right lens being fogged you will now Â use or right eye for reading and not your left eye*</p>
<p>Â  *But what about my left eye won&rsquo;t I see double&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,for your left eye you will have a black Plano lens; Â that&rsquo;s a black lens with no prescription in it and I have added a black side cap to it,so you won&rsquo;t see anything out of that eyeÂ 
&ldquo;Let be put them on you then you understand</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that&rsquo;s feels strange it feels like I&rsquo;m blind in my left eye,but wow I can read 4 line on the small card&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annabell suggested she order a taxi,I thought that was a good idea and suggested we stop at the tobacconist as I wanted to replace the case I had given Judy.</p>
<p>As soon as we walked into the shop the lady recognised me .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello how are you,my father said you came in this morning,I&rsquo;m sorry I missed you,are you enjoying smoking now&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes thank you this is my friend. I told you about the lady that tests my eyes,when she knew I smoked she wanted to try,so she is a smoker now as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have new glasses since you were in last I love the colour it matches your friends&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes my friend tested my eyes this afternoon,my eyesight has got a lot worse so I need these new glasses and a new pair of reading glasses&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O do you still have your old reading glasses with you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes they are in my handbag&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PLEASE COULD I TRY THEM AGAIN.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do your remember I could see so good when I put them on&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O thank you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;WOW Â that&rsquo;s so clear,I can read the sign across the side of the shop&rdquo;
&ldquo;Normally I can&rsquo;t see that&rdquo;
&ldquo;My left eye is unless,but with these glasses on I can see better with just that eye than can with my 2 eyes&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anabelle suggested the lady came to our house tomorrow as she had brought her portable testing set with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be wonderful if you could test my eyes but I must work all day tomorrow could I come the next day&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes that would be fine would you like to come for lunch&rdquo;Â 
&ldquo;Yes please that would be lovely&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went bright red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I keep the glasses on I can see so much better with them.I can bring them with me when I come to you for lunch&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Annable</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes that&rsquo;s fine your seem to need that sort of prescription for your left eye we can see what you need for your right eye when I test you&rdquo;</p>
<p>I interrupted.&ldquo;what about your boyfriend you said he hated girls wearing glasses,and the glasses need are going to very different to what most girls wear&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind what he thinks I can see so much better wearing these,so I want my own glasses to wear all the time&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father will be pleased.he keeps telling me I need glasses and he doesn&rsquo;t like my boyfriendâ</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually I&rsquo;m getting tired of boys they are only interested in boobs,and you two look so happy, it&rsquo;s obvious you are very much in love with each other&rdquo;</p>
