        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>The 2 kids walking down the street made a very odd looking couple. He was thin and was dressed in black jeans and a black short sleeved T shirt. On his arms were a number of tattoo’s and he looked as if he were a little undernourished for his 6” 2 or so height. His female companion was around a foot shorter than he was, and she was definitely not undernourished. Her rotund figure was dressed in a shade of black that perfectly matched her hair. She had piercings all down her ears that were filled with silver studs and on the petite nose of her rather chubby little face sat a pair of heavy framed black glasses with lenses that would be considered extremely thick by even the most casual of observers. They were either a few weeks early for Halloween, or they were the unlikeliest Goth couple I had ever seen.
 
I had just moved into the neighborhood a couple of weeks earlier, and I knew I had never seen either of them before as I am a keen observer of girls that wear glasses and this young lady was one of the most nearsighted 15 or16 year old girls I had ever seen. I watched as they drew closer and I sang out a friendly “Hi”. She looked my way and I saw her face scrunch up to focus her eyes behind the thick lenses. She smiled and replied to my “hi” with one of her own. He didn’t say anything, but just nodded his head to acknowledge my presence.
 
“I’m Cindy. Did your family just move in?” She asked.
 
“We did. I am Devlin, and I will be going into grade 12 at the high school.” I responded.
 
“Mind your manners Travis. He is going to be in the same grade as you so introduce yourself to Devlin before he thinks you are a real jerk.” Cindy said to her companion.
 
“Hi Devlin. I am Travis and I am Cindy’s brother.” Travis said as he shook my hand.
 
We chatted for a few more minutes. I looked at Cindy a couple of times and I am sure she was trying to hustle me. There was a bit of a problem though. No, not the glasses. The glasses were perfect. It was her weight. I am only 5’9, so her being a little short didn’t bother me at all. It was just the fact that she needed to lose at least 20 or more pounds.
 
Travis finally told his sister to quit talking and come on home or he would leave her behind. I almost volunteered to walk her home but I didn’t want to make her think I was as interested in her as I really was. She was now likely bemoaning the fact that I was likely thinking that she looked terrible with her thick glasses to her brother.  Little could she know that her glasses were the one thing that could make me overlook a little bit of extra weight.
 
My mom wore thick glasses and I know my dad married her because of the strong glasses she wore. After she died when I was 6 my dad was pretty unhappy. There was only the two of us and dad did a fair bit of drinking. One afternoon after school a couple of years after mom died I came home from school and found dad sitting at the kitchen table drinking. That wasn’t so unusual. What was weird was the fact that dad was wearing a very thick looking pair of men’s glasses. That evening, as he sobered up, dad told me that he had an obsession for glasses. I hadn’t realized it, but when mom was still alive he often went out in the evening with her wearing plus contact lenses with a strong pair of minus glasses over them. And, during the past 10 years since mom died dad had dated a few ladies, but not one of them had suited him, as they did not wear glasses.
 
My father doing GOC had opened my eyes to all sorts of glasses things. I developed a keen interest in glasses and in girls that wore glasses myself. Dad had introduced me to the world of GOC and he had gotten me a contact lens and thick minus glasses combination that I could see very well with. Whenever we went on holidays we both wore GOC and it was fun doing it together. We often talked about our GOC excursions and we wondered what people had thought when they saw the man wearing thick glasses accompanied by a son who also wore thick minus glasses. On days that dad felt like wearing his GOC combination he could now come home and not worry about me catching him, and that made things much easier for him. Of course, the perfect solution for him would be for him to meet a really nearsighted lady, but they are few and far between. That is why I was in such a quandary over Cindy. She would be almost perfect if she dumped the black ensemble and lost a few pounds.  But I wasn’t going to obsess over it.
 
There was still a week to go before school started. If Travis went to high school and was in my grade that meant that either Cindy was in grade 9 at the Junior High, or else she was in grade 10 at the school Travis and I were going to. I should have asked her, but I figured I would find out soon enough. She had made a comment when we were talking about Travis being her Seeing Eye guide. I didn’t know if that meant that her eyesight was so poor that she really couldn’t see without someone helping her around or if it just meant that sometimes he was her eyes. I wouldn’t have been as interested in Cindy if her vision had been so bad she needed a full time guide, but from the way she scrunched up her eyes I was thinking that maybe she had a new pair of glasses on order.
 
I sort of hoped that she and Travis might come walking by again, so I was watching the front walk fairly carefully. That morning I almost missed them walking by. I could have run after them, but I didn’t want to seem too obvious and I made sure I was out front the rest of the day. I mowed the lawn, and then I raked the grass clippings up. I trimmed the bushes, and weeded the flower beds. I was running out of things to do when I spotted them walking down the sidewalk towards me. I stood up and said hi to them. Travis was a bit more personable today, and I thought that meant I might get along with him. Cindy had actually gotten new glasses. I think the frame lens size might have been a little larger than her old heavy black glasses because the lenses looked to be a lot thicker. The front of her lenses were dished in a fair bit and I thought that if she needed a drink of water she could fill up the front of her lenses and get a drink. Well, maybe they weren’t that bad, but they sure were deeply dished in.
 
Travis wanted to get going, but Cindy wanted to stay and talk. Finally she told him to head on home. She said she could see much better with her new glasses now so she didn’t need him to help her find her way.
 
“I thought you had gotten new glasses. They look nice. I like the red color better than your black ones.” I said.
 
“Thank you Devlin, but you don’t have to sugar coat it. They look thick and they are thick. I got awfully bad eyes.” Cindy said.
 
“I could sort of tell that. But the red frames look nicer than your other ones did. You can’t help how bad your eyesight is and as long as you can see then it doesn’t matter how thick your glasses are.” I replied.
 
“I bet you wouldn’t ever ask a girl as blind as me out. I would love to get contact lenses, but I can’t wear them because my eyes are too dry.” Cindy said.
 
‘Well don’t be so sure I wouldn’t ask you out. My mom wore pretty thick glasses and her glasses didn’t make her any less of a person and I don’t think yours make you any less of a person either.” I responded.
 
“Where is your mom now?” Cindy asked.
 
“She died when I was 6. There is just my dad and I.” I answered.
 
I found out that Cindy was in grade 10 at my high school. She was 15 and she would be 16 in January. Travis was a year and a half older and he was in my grade, but because of his birth date he had started school earlier. I was already 17 and would be 18 before I graduated, but that was because I had failed a grade back when mom died. We had pretty well finished talking and Cindy was about to head home when I told her I would walk her home.
 
Cindy lived 3 blocks away on a different street. When we got to her house she asked me if I wanted to come in for a soda, so I took her up on the invitation. Travis was sitting inside playing a video game on the television and Cindy and I sat in the kitchen drinking our sodas. Cindy had to get some stuff out for supper and while she did that we kept talking. I was getting ready to go back home when I heard a car door close. A lady walked in the door and Cindy introduced me to her mom. When I saw Doreen, I thought that maybe this lady might be a good one for my dad, as Cindy had told me that her mom and dad were divorced. Cindy’s mom was a little heavier than I would have liked, but then so was Cindy. Cindy had told me that she was born premature, but after seeing her mom I figured that Cindy would have been nearsighted anyway – just maybe not as much. Her mom had a pretty serious myopic prescription, like around -20D.
 
The first few weeks of school were interesting. I think Cindy had staked her claim on me, because I could barely turn around without her being by my side. I guess I really didn’t mind, because every time I looked at her wearing her glasses she made me horny as could be. I wasn’t sure, but it also seemed to me that Cindy was either losing a bit of weight or I had accepted the fact that she was a little heavier than I would have liked. She had also dropped the black Goth clothing she had been wearing and she had lost the black eye makeup. That was good, because the black looked weird behind the thick lenses of her glasses.
 
I asked Cindy to the Halloween Dance, and we actually had a great time. The dance ended at midnight, but her mom wanted her home by then, so we left the dance in plenty of time to make the curfew.
 
For Thanksgiving Dad and I always cooked a turkey. Then we had leftovers for a week or two.  Dad had seen Cindy around with me and we had discussed her eyewear and her eyesight frequently. Dad knew I had the obsession bad and all he told me was that I needed to be sure that I was prepared to take care of Cindy if her eyes got to a point where she could no longer see. Cindy and I had talked about that, and apparently her doctor thought her eyesight progression was about over and her chance of retinal detachments could be controlled by frequent monitoring so that was good news. I asked dad if we could invite Travis, Cindy and Doreen to have dinner with us. I had mentioned a while back that Doreen was quite nearsighted, but slightly overweight and when I suggested the invite dad told me to go right ahead.
 
I had not said a word to Cindy about her weight. I guess she had decided to do something about it on her own because by Thanksgiving she had dropped about 10 lbs. I had seen her mom a few times throughout the fall and I thought her mom had also dropped a few pounds. When Doreen and Cindy showed up along with Travis for Thanksgiving dinner, both mother and daughter looked thinner, and I made sure I complimented them on that. Dad was just meeting Doreen for the first time, so he did not know that she had lost weight. But I could tell that dad was quite impressed with Doreen. I know it was not just her glasses, but the fact was that both Cindy and Doreen looked very attractive. Dad had often told me that a pair of nice glasses does not mean that the person is compatible.
 
By the end of that school year Doreen and dad were a couple. There were a few evenings where Cindy had come over to be with me at our house, but she always went home. Dad didn’t always come home. I figured they were old enough to make sure that Cindy and I didn’t have a half-brother or half-sister and I knew that Cindy and I were not ready to have children. She was only 16, and while I was now 18 I was not ready to be a dad.
 
Since we had started dating Cindy was now looking darned good to me. She still wore the red glasses with the deeply dished in front surface, but she had let her hair grow out to her natural light brown color. She had dropped close to 25 pounds and her face was no longer chubby looking. She only wore 2 studs in each ear and she had let the other holes grow closed. She also no longer wore her nose ring. If it hadn’t been for the glasses that allowed her see anything beyond the end of her nose she likely would have been chased after by some of the other guys.
 
That summer dad and Doreen decided to get married. Travis was heading off to university in the city and was going to live with his father there. We were going to sell our house and move in with Cindy and Doreen. I wasn’t too sure how great an idea that would be. I would get the room that Travis had been living in but I was also going to be in close proximity to Cindy all the time. I was going to school to be an operating engineer and then after 6 months I would be running dozer’s and track hoes and loaders along with other construction equipment. Cindy still had 2 more years of high school before we could get married. It was going to be hell keeping my hands off Cindy.
 
Dad and Doreen must have been thinking the same thing. I had been in Travis’s old room for about a month when they wanted to speak to Cindy and me together.  I knew Cindy was on birth control pills, but knowing that had not given me a license to take Cindy to bed. I wanted to and it sure had been hard seeing her every day, but I had managed to keep my desires under control. When Doreen and dad talked to both Cindy and I they suggested that they could put a queen bed in Travis’s room and Cindy and I could sleep together. It was up to us to be careful to not get Cindy pregnant – even though she was on the pill an accident could still happen.
 
This was just like we had been given a license to have sex. We wasted no time getting the bedroom set up and now Cindy and I were sleeping together every night. I guess that was about the best introduction I could ever get to what married life was going to be like. And let me tell you that it was great. My very nearsighted, formerly plump, little girlfriend was great in bed. It was almost as if she had been having sex from an early age, but her mom had talked to her and told her how I needed to use my fingers in her vagina before I penetrated in order to moisten and excite her and that if I sucked her nipples when we were having sex that would excite her even more. And little things like that made the experience even more pleasurable.
 
Dad had been hesitant to let Doreen in on his wearing of GOC. But finally he told her about it and while she first thought it was a little weird she let him wear GOC during sex. I guess it must have been pretty good for them because now dad wore his glasses around the house on the weekends sometimes. Cindy asked me all about this, and I confessed to her that dad had gotten me GOC glasses and contacts to wear, so Cindy wanted me to try wearing the glasses when we had sex. I did, and this broke the ice. Now sometimes dad and I would go to a shopping center with Cindy and Doreen and we would all be wearing strong glasses.
 
Cindy and I are going to get married once she graduates from high school. She will stop taking the pill just before she turns 18, and we will marry that summer. We want to have children early and we hope that we do not have a premature baby. It is highly likely that Cindy would have been nearsighted anyway because of her mom’s myopia, but the fact that Cindy was born premature at 32 weeks likely caused her to be a whole lot more myopic. It would be better to have children that have a lower prescription than her -30D, but she has been fortunate so far in that she still can see reasonably well. And dad and I certainly have no problem with the thought of having nearsighted children and grandchildren around.
