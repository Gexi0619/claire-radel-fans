        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>She now likes eyeglasses</p>
<p>Doctor Brown and his wife have three children.
Ashley the oldest, is  in her final year at high school
A  very attractive girl , with beautiful auburn  wavy hair , and  a well proportioned body
Always well dressed ,and looking her best.
She is very  popular at school., and has lots of friends .
She has two younger brothers Patrick who is now in his third year and Bryson who just started high school.</p>
<p>Every year before school starts all of them go for their annual eye exam.
Two years ago Patrick was prescribed glasses for hyperopia and he has some astigmatism.
He wears his glasses proudly and is happy to see well and no headaches.
Ashley told him she does not like the looks of his glasses .
I don t like the way  your  lenses make your  eyes look so much larger.
She  asked Patrick why he wears his glasses all the time.
He told her  he needs them to see properlyand has no headaches.
He does not mind wearing glasses.</p>
<p>After the yearly eye exam, Ashley is always so happy.
No glasses for her , her eyes are healthy  .
At this years exam Bryson was prescribed glasses.
He is like his brother hyperopic and has some astigmatism ..</p>
<p>Ashley does not like the idea of both of her brothers wearing glasses..
What will people think, that she should be wearing glasses to ?
She sure does not like glasses ,she thinks it is a sign that you are not healthy.</p>
<p>The high school football season is always very important.
The star quarter back Logan , has been  Ashley s boyfriend for almost three years..
He has been one of the better players on the school football team every year .
A  handsome well build athletic type of guy , always a big smile on his face.
and  also a very good student .</p>
<p>Ashley and Logan usually go out once a week.
They both enjoy  going to see a movie.
Their favorite seats are near the back of the theater ,
Lately Logan mentioned he seems to get a headache watching the movie.
He suggested the next time to get seats near the center , it might be a little  easier on the eyes.</p>
<p>Logan s coach noticed that Logan  this year is not playing as well as before.
Many  of his passes are  of the mark .
He has no idea what is wrong.</p>
<p>The next time Ashley and Logan went to see a movie , they  sat in the seats Logan had suggested.
After the movie he told Asley that is better, I don t  have a headache.
When they were sitting at the food court in the mall .
Logan was very surprised , when  he noticed that  he had trouble reading the menu board.
He asked Ashley if she had any trouble reading the menu board.
Ashley had no trouble at all , and asked him if there was something wrong.
Logan told her I think I have a vision problem.,things far away look a  bit blurry.
I think I might need  glasses.
Ashley told him , I hope you are wrong .
I don t like the looks of glasses , and  I don t think you need them.
The next time we go and see a movie we can sit closer to the front., if that helps you.</p>
<p>Logan knew he had a vision problem, and went for an eye exam.
He was told he is mypopic and should wear glasses.
His prescription read – 0.75 for the right and – 1.00 for the left eye.
With the help of the optician he selected a pair of glasses that would fit under his football helmet.
He knew he should  wear his glasses so he could see his receivers better.
The next game he played wearing his glasses ,his passes were right on, and they won the game.
The coach congratulated Logan  and told him he was glad he is wearing  glasses now, they sure helped to  improve his game.
Logan was not wearing his glasses when Ashley met him ,and she congratulated him on a  great game .</p>
<p>On the next date Logan did not know what to do.
He liked wearing his glasses and being able to see so well.
He  also knew Ashley did not like glasses.
They took their seats , and the movie started .
About 5 minutes later, Logan   pulled his glasses  case  out of his pocket and put his glasses  on.
What !!!! you are wearing glasses, how come you did not tell me you are wearing glasses now ?
I did not want to upset you.
I am sorry, but I have to wear them  to see the movie properly.
Why did you not get contact lenses ?
The doctor told me that I most likely need an increase in my prescription in about 6 months, .
He suggested  to wait getting contact lenses till my prescription has stabilized.
I wore my glasses during our last football game and they sure improved my vision.
I am sorry I need to wear glasses.
I will only wear my glasses when I am with you , when I really need  them to see properly .
So during the next few months Ashley was happy that she did not see Logan wear his glasses very often.</p>
<p>Graduation time came.
Everybody was excited about the prom.
When Logan arrived at Ashley place , she was all dressed and looked fantastic.
He presented her with a beautful corsage, which she asked him to pin  on .
She loved it and gave him a big kiss.
Driving to the school, Logan drove slowly because  he did not wear his glasses.
They had a great time at the prom and hated for the dance to end.
After saying goodbye to everybody they left for home.</p>
<p>On the way homeLogan told Ashley he was sorry  that he had to wear his glasses.
I need to wear my glasses to see properly when  driving at night.
When Logan  drove  through an  intersection while the light was green ,a car ran the red light.
Logan noticed the car coming and  braked hard.
The car  hit the the front part of Logan s car on the passesnger side.
The air bag released and hit Ashley so hard in the face it knocked her unconcious.
Logan was not hurt  .
He got  got out of the car and checked on Ashley ,she was unconscious ., there was nothing he could do.
Police arrived soon after and  called for an ambulance.
The guy in the car that hit them  was sitting in his car leaning over his steering wheel ,
not hurt ,just drunk.
When the ambulance arrived the paramedics  quickly looked after Ashley, and rushed her and Logan to the hospital.
When they got there , Logan  phoned Asley s parents and arranged he would meet them at the admission desk.
It did not take Ashley s parents very long to get there.
Dr.Brown went to see ,what he could find out about Ashley s condition .</p>
<p>While they were waiting ,Mrs. Brown, after hearing everything about the accident, commented on Logan s glasses , and how nice he looked wearing glasses.
Logan thanked her and told her he does not wear them as much as he should.
Ashley  does not like to see me wearing  glasses.
Yes , I know she has a thing about glasses.
Then Dr. Brown came back and told them that Ashley was consious now.
She had asked about Logan and what had happened.
They did a M R I and there does not appear to be any brain damage.
Her forehead and eyes are very swollen, she cannot open her eyes
Most important thing right now is  to reduce the swelling so she can open her eyes,
Then the doctors can check her eyes  to see if there is any damge.
They gave her a sedative and hope she will have a good night s rest.
Doctor and Mrs. brown gave Logan a ride home home ,and they all were  hoping for the best.</p>
<p>The next day Ashley s swelling had gone down a little, but still could not open her eyes
The Doctors were afraid   Ashley might have some serious eye damage
and  decided to send her  to the University Hospital Opthamology department.</p>
<p>Doctor Jenny Ferguson is now in charge of Ashley s rehabilitation.
After a couple of days  the swelling was  pretty well gone.
Ashley now  complains about her  vision , it seems very fuzzy and distorted.
Dr .Ferguson told her you had a traumatic  injury which can cause an imbalance  in the refrective stage, and it sometimes can cause  myopia and or astigmatism .
Ashley asked her ,will I have to wear glasses?
There is a possibility, we cannot tell until you have a complete eye exam.
We cannot give you a proper eye exam until all the swelling and  traces of blood are  completely gone .</p>
<p>Logan was wearing his glasses  when he  came to visit Ashley .
When he asked her how she was doing , she told him that because of the damage to her eyes ,
she might have to wear glasses .
I hope you don t mind ?
Why would I , if you need glasses wear them, I am sure you will look beautiful.
Now Ashley started to feel a little  better.</p>
<p>About three days later Ashley had her eye exam .
Because Ashley had  eye exams before ,  was familiar with the routine of an eye exam.
She soon realized that her vision was not good.
When the phoropter was in front of her face ,she noticed that  every time she heard  a click she could see better .
Then she went through which is better  1 or 2 and so on.
When the exam was finished the doctor told her she is now myopic and has quite a bit of astigmatism.
Sorry Ashley but you will have to wear glasses .
With this prescription it will be a few days  of wearing your glasses before you will be able  to see perfect and  be comfortable wearing your glasses,
Put your glasses on when you get up in the morning and don t take them off until you go to bed at night.
Soon you will be comfortable with wearing glasses , and also  seeing  yourself wearing glasses.
I have send a copy of your prescription to our department lab.
Your  glasses will be ready for you shortly.
The Doctor and Ashley talked some more ,
About 20 minutes later an optician delivered the glasses .
She asked Ashley to put the glasses on , so she could adjust the glasses.
After the adjustnent  Ashley  looked around and  noticed  she could almost perfect.
Looking through the lenses made her eyes feel funny.
When she looked in a mirror and looked at herself , was shocked this was not her.
She hated her new look , and almost started to cry.
The Doctor told her, you will look better when all the bruises are gone.
When you get some fashionable frames, and some make up,  you will  feel much better having to wear glasses.
Here is your prescription , I would like you to have another exam in about  six months .</p>
<p>Mrs Brown came to take Ashley home.
She looked at Ashley wearing her glasses , you look cute wearing glasses , I like your new look.
Oh mom you said that to make me feel better, I hate my new look.
When Ashley came home , her dad and brothers all said she looked nice wearing glasses.</p>
<p>A few days later Logan phoned Ashley and told her ,he had a new car, and they made arrangements  to go out the next  night.
Ashley wondered what Logan would say seeing her wearing glasses.
She wanted to  make sure she look her best.
Looking on  the internet  at some videos about make up when you wear glasses , gave her some ideas.
She carefully applied her make up and when finished was surprised how much better  she looked.
To make sure she checked with her mother to see if she did not apply to much make up.
Her mother was sure Logan will love your new look .</p>
<p>When Logan  looked at  Ashley , smiled and said you look fantastic wearing glasses .
I bet, you never realized you could look so good wearing glasses.
How is your vision now?
I can see as good as I could before the accident, but cannot see very well without my glasses.
Well in a way I am a lucky girl .
Because you wore your glasses that night, and slammed on the brakes when you saw that car coming,
I only got hurt by an air bag , and now have to wear glasses .
It could have been much worse if you had not worn your glasses.
I have changed my mind,now  I do like eyeglasses, and will  make sure you wear yours to.</p>
