        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>I am glad, I went deaf.</p>
<p>When, I was in grade two, I started to have trouble reading, what was written on the blackboard, and the grades on my report cards were not very good.
My mother went to see my teacher, to ask her if she might know, what my problem might be.
I think, Nancy might have a vision problem, I would suggest that she would benefit from having an eye exam.
Thank you, you might be right, I have seen her do a lot of squinting lately, I will make sure, she has her vision checked.</p>
<p>I live next door to Jenny, she is in my class, and we have been friends for a long time., Jenny has told me, that lately, she can hardly read, what is written on the blackboard.
Now I know, I am not the only one.</p>
<p>I had an eye exam, and was prescribed to wear glasses, that I did not want to wear.
I am not going to school wearing glasses, and have everybody, make fun of me, I am not telling anybody, not even Jenny, that I now have to wear glasses.</p>
<p>When I got my glasses, and put them on, for the first time, I could not believe how nice and clear everything looked, and that now, I could see everything far away, so nice and clear.
On the way home I looked at everything, with and without wearing my glasses, and I think, I might like to wear the glasses, but not when I go to school.
I liked wearing my glasses around home, and when riding on my bike, but not to school, I don’t want anyone to know, that I wear glasses.</p>
<p>My mother told me, that when you squint a lot, your eyeballs get out of shape, and you will end up wearing glasses with very thick lenses.
That did not scare me enough, to start wearing my glasses to school.</p>
<p>What I did not know, that Jenny, the girl who lives next door, who is my friend and class mate, has never told me, that she had an eye exam, and has to wear glasses, and she is like me, she does not want to wear her glasses, when going to school.</p>
<p>Our parents must have found out, that we were not wearing our glasses.
Our teacher, this morning, gave a talk on vision, and wearing glasses.
She explained, that if she did not wear her glasses, she would not be able to see well enough, to teach, and if you have to wear glasses, you should wear them., they help you to see properly, and are nothing to be ashamed of.
Your classmates Jenny, and Nancy, have to wear glasses and they will show you, how nice they look wearing glasses.
When everybody was looking at us, we slowly put our glasses on. .
Now you can see, how nice they look wearing glasses, and both Jenny and I have been wearing our glasses, ever since that happened.</p>
<p>Jenny, is myopic, and we both wear about the same prescription, of -1.50.
Because Jenny is now wearing glasses, I feel so much better about wearing mine, and I soon found out that when playing ball, and other games, at least you can see the ball, and makes playing more fun.</p>
<p>When you are growing up, everything grows, my body is now, starting to show some curves, I have grown taller, and so did my prescription, I now wear a – 3.50 prescription , and by the time I went to high school, my prescription was already, in the – 5.50 range, and I am still growing.</p>
<p>Jenny, after her last eye exam, is also in the -5.00 range, and she loves wearing her glasses, with her beautiful head of hair, and a nice looking body, and wearing a frame, that blends with her hair colour, she looks fantastic.</p>
<p>When Jenny and I finished high school, we both are wearing -12.00 glasses, and believe it or not, we both would not mind, an even stronger prescriptions, because we love the looks of the rings and depth showing in the lenses.</p>
<p>We spend a lot of time together, and love to exchange glasses, and all kinds of girly stuff, I know we love each other., like sisters</p>
<p>We both, went to college for two years, to prepare us for a dependable job.
After studying hard those two years, our glasses prescriptions, are past -14.00 now.
We always have so much fun, trying to find the right frames for our new glasses</p>
<p>Because, both of us are working in the same city, and trying to save some money, we are sharing an apartment
We both like our jobs, and after work our evenings together.
Jenny works at a car dealer, doing office work, I work at a law office, and we both have now a regular paycheck.</p>
<p>We like it, when we can go shopping together, to buy what we like, and spend our free time together.
After our last eye exam, our prescriptions increased only 1/2 diopter, and now we order our glasses on line, so we can afford more than one pair.
We just love wearing our glasses.</p>
<p>When, I came home last night, Jenny, was lying on the sofa
Jenny what is wrong?
What did you say?
I went over to the sofa, and asked her again, what is wrong?
I can hardly hear you, I think I am going deaf.
What happened?
There was an explosion, that is all I can remember, and my boss drove me home.</p>
<p>I phoned Jenny’s boss to find out what happened.
He told me his son, had put too much air in an old tire, and that he had left it, with the air pressure on, and it blew up, and the loud explosion even blew out some windows, The explosion might have affected Jenny’s hearing, and to let him know in the morning how she is.</p>
<p>The next morning, I phoned Jenny’s boss and told him about her hearing loss.
He suggested, to go to the hearing clinic, and get her hearing checked, and he will pay the bill.</p>
<p>I took the morning off, to take Jenny, to the hearing clinic.
After a thorough examination, they told us, that the explosion was the reason for Jenny’s hearing loss.
After they fitted Jenny with hearing aids, she can now hear again, but will have to wear the hearing aids, for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>When we came home, Jenny looked in the mirror, to see what she looked like wearing hearing aids.
I told her she looks as beautiful as she always does, and I love her new look, gave her a hug and a kiss, hoping she will feel better.</p>
<p>Jenny, now likes wearing her hearing aids, she can control the volume, a feature that she really likes.</p>
<p>Because of the accident, and to avoid a lawsuit, for Jenny’s hearing loss, the dealership’s, insurance, offered. Jenny a large amount of money.
She accepted the money and now she has a healthy bank account.</p>
<p>To day, we were discussing men, and the dates we have had, Jenny said, I think, it is time, to start thinking about getting married.
How are we going to do that?
I will let you know.</p>
<p>About two weeks later, Jenny asked me to pack my suitcase, for a little vacation.
With a holiday, being on a Thursday, we are going to have a long weekend, at a fancy ski resort.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, after work, we jumped in the car and drove to the ski resort.
When we entered the main building, for our reservations, we were surprised about large the number of people in the building.
We took our suitcases to our room, and decided to dress up, and wear our favourite glasses before we went to the chalet, because there is going to be live music and dancing to night.</p>
<p>When we entered the dance area, sat down, and looked at all the people that sat around, waiting for the music to start.
We both felt really good about our appearance, we were wearing our favourite glasses with frames, that blended with our outfits.
We ordered a glass of wine, and waited for the music to start.
When we were ready to start dancing, two gentlemen approached our table, and asked us for a dance.
We accepted, and I was fortunate, a man a little taller than I am, with a nice head of hair, he wears myopic glasses, that make him look studious. he is a good dancer, and Logan is easy to talk to.,</p>
<p>The chap, Jenny was dancing with, is a real good looking guy, and they seem to get along well.</p>
<p>After a few dances, Logan asked if he could sit with us, yes please sit down.
When Jenny and her partner, Kevin said down with us , Jenny told me that Kevin had commented on how he liked the looks of my hearing aids, and my glasses, and told me I looked fantastic</p>
<p>Kevin and Logan are brothers, both are optometrists and own an optical store, on the other side of the city where we live..
We again, were complimented on how nice we looked, and a short time later, when we were talking about glasses, they complimented us how nice we looked wearing glasses.
Kevin thought we all should be wearing glasses, so he removed his contact lenses, and put his glasses on, wow, they sure are good looking, glasses wearing guys.</p>
<p>The next four days at the ski resort flew by, we had a great time with Logan and Kevin and are a to meet with them again next weekend, at their optical store.</p>
<p>Jenny is all excited about Kevin and told me again, how he liked her hearing aids, that they turned him on, and loves the looks of her glasses, I think Jenny is in love.</p>
<p>The following Saturday, we drove to see Kevin and Logan at their optical store.
When we entered the store, the optician told us that both doctors were with their last patients for the day, she offered us some coffee, while we were looking around.
We always enjoy looking at all the frames, and to see if there are any we like better than the ones we are wearing right now.
We noticed there was a selection, of the most beautiful looking frames, we had ever seen.
One of us tried the frames, while the other took a photo, of the frame we were wearing, on our phone.
We were so busy, that we had not noticed that both Logan and Kevin standing there watching us.
Are you ladies ready for lunch?
We turned around, and looked at them, yes, we are now.</p>
<p>We went to an Italian restaurant, and had a great meal with some nice wine., when we were finished with our meal, Kevin asked if he could see the photo’s of us trying glasses frames.
Looking at the pictures, all we heard was, humm, wow,, humm ,wow, and when they were finished looking at all the pictures , they both agreed something should be done about it.</p>
<p>What do you guys mean something should be done about it?
Well, trust us, you won’t be sorry.
Then, we returned to the optical store, and were asked if we would like an up to date exam.
We gave our permission, we liked the idea.
I enjoyed the exam, but wondered why, he tried to fit me with contact lenses.</p>
<p>After the exam, they suggested, we try the frames, that we like so well again, so they could see us wearing the frames.
We enjoyed showing the frames, and looking at the bulge in the boys pants, noticed that they did to.
At last, we all settled on a frame, that everybody liked.
After the necessary measurements were done, we were told the glasses would be delivered the following Saturday, to our apartment.</p>
<p>We spend the whole weekend with Kevin and Logan, and are all excited, and wondering, what next weekend will bring..</p>
<p>We were all ready, when Kevin and Logan came, what had happened to them ?
They were wearing very high prescription glasses.
When I asked, he told me not to worry about it, we will tell you all about it later.
They looked around our apartment, and before they sat down, placed a package on the table when we opened it there were 4 glasses cases.2 for each of us.
When we opened the cases, there were 2 identical frames, but the difference was in the lenses, one par in high, and one pair low index lenses, what a difference in the thickness of the lenses at the edges.
I asked them, do we wear the thick lenses around here, and the thin ones when we go out?
You got it, said both of them, the thick lenses look so sexy, and the thin ones are for when you are dressed, and wearing the thick lenses comes later.
I notice there were also some containers with what I think, are contact lenses.
When I asked Logan about it, he said, we will give you a real thrill.
He asked me to put the contact lenses in, and then the glasses with the thick lenses.
When I put the glasses on could nor believe what I saw, everything I looked at looked smaller and further away, what an experience.
He took my hand, and we slowly walked around the apartment, so I got used to my new vision, wearing – 25.00 glasses
When both Jenny and I were used to wear the strong glasses over the contact lenses, the boys decided we go out for lunch.
We walked down the street to The Surf and Turf restaurant, when we entered everybody seemed to be looking at us, and wonder about the thick lenses on our glasses.
I found it a real exciting experience, wearing the strong glasses, and looking across the table at Jenny and Kevin, made me feel sexy/..</p>
<p>When we got back to our apartment, well fed and drunk, we did a lot of exciting things,
that I don’t want to talk about, but we had a great time.
The next day, when the boys left, we were ready to sit back and unwind, and wonder what is going to happen next weekend, when we go to their place.</p>
<p>The following week when we met the boys, we went for lunch, all of us wearing our G.O.C.
After lunch we went for s drive, and stopped in a driveway of a brand new house.
We all got out of the car, Logan invited me into the house, while Jenny and Kevin walked to the other house.
When we walked through the house, Logan asked me, if I liked his new home, I think it is beautiful
Logan went on one knee, and asked me to come and live with him, and be his wife,
Yes, I would love to, and then he put a beautiful ring on my finger
Jenny had the same experience, and now we are both going to get married.</p>
<p>Like Jenny said, I am glad I went deaf, because all this would not have happened.</p>
