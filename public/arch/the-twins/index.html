          <p>In is story we are bringing back Jim and Marsha, now Dr. Jim Morgan the optometrist and his wife Marsha an optician. They own and operate Jones Optical [See Jim and Marsha 1,2,3 fort he story.</p>
<p>Near the High School and a nice park was a new subdivision with middle class type homes. The Parker family had recently moved there, they had twin girls, Lindsay and Megan , who went to high school , and a younger boy David.
The Girls were active in sports and school activities and were good students. Lindsay always liked to sit in front of the class, Megan liked to sit further back.  Bryson a nice boy sat in the next seat to her. He was really good in math. and when  Megan had a problem would help her. Bryson was quite a good athlete and on the football team. He was a handsome boy, wore glasses as he was slightly myopic, but he did not mind he could see properly and that helped him with his studies.
Megan sometimes had trouble getting all her notes, but Bryson  would pass her his book so she could copy what she needed.
The following week Bryson told Megan he was in a hurry to get to football practice, took off his glasses put them in a case, put all his
books in his bag and left.  Megan finished her notes, and got up to leave. than she noticed there was a glass case on Brysons  desk, he had forgotten to pack his glasses. Megan picked up the case and put it in her bag and went home.
That night when the girls were doing their homework , Megan noticed  the glasses case in her bag, she had forgotten about it.
She took the case out of her bag and carefully opened it. She did not know very much about glasses, could only remember trying another girls  once.when she was in grade 4. She looked at the glasses, a gold metal frame, and took them out of the case.
The glasses did not feel heavy and she could not resist trying them on.She looked around the room and notice the noticed the numbers on the wall  calender looked sharp and clear, everything seemed brighter.
Lindsay how do you like my new look? Lindsay looked at her and asked where did you get those glasses? Megan told her what had happened and asked would you like to try them? Lindsay said yes I would like to, she put the glasses on and looked around, I think everything looks a little smaller but very clear, Megan said I thought so to. Do you think we need glasses? I don t want any said Lindsay , they spoil your looks, did you see Carla, she now wears glasses and looks terrible. Megan said I never gave it much thought, but I don t think we need them. She put the glasses back into the case and back in her schoolbag and went back to her homework.
The next day Bryson asked  her if she had seen his glasses, she said yes, you left them on your desk so I put them in my bag, they are right here and handed Bryson the case. Thanks you saved the day, I have a hard time seeing the blackboard when not wearing them, matter of fact I think I need my prescription changed and get stronger lenses, I also want to get contacts for when I play sports.
Megan asked Bryson if the glasses made that much difference? Here try them on  and look at he blackboard . Megan was surprised how much easier it was to read the writing on the blackboard. She said I notice some difference, but I don t think I need glasses.
So everything went on as usual.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later new people moved into the house next door. Dr. Morgan an optometrist and his wife Marsha an optician, they owned and operated Jones Optical across from the mall. They had a 6 year old girl Kathy , and a 5 year old boy Jim jr.
It did not take long for the neighbors to meet and get to know each other.  And soon Lindsay and Megan became their regular baby sitters.
Mrs. Parker [ Karen] would visit with Marsha once and a while and have coffee with her. They enjoyed each others company and the main topic of conversation usually  was their children.   One day when they were having coffee, Karen mentioned to Marsha that
she seemed to have more headaches lately, usually when sowing or reading. Marsha said I think you are started to get longsighted
Perhaps you should get you eyes examined, you might need glasses.
Karen did not realize that wearing glasses might fix her problem. Would I have to wear glasses all the time? Only a complete eye exam will answer tat question.
That night Karen discussed it with her husband, he thought she should make an appointment and fin out.
The next day Karen made an appointment at Jones Optical;.
When she went for her appointment, she was quite nervous, this was a whole new experience.
She went into the optical shop not knowing what to expect. The friendly staff put her at ease. The exam went well  and Jim told her that wearing glasses should solve her problem. With the help of the optician she selected a frame that she thought looked really good , and was told to come back in about an hour and her glasses would be ready.
Karen wondered what kind of reaction she would be getting from  her family, they did not know she was having an eye exam.
After she picked up her glasses and looked at herself in the mirror, she was satisfied with her new look and went home.
She wore the glasses the rest of the day and did not have a headache and was happy that the glasses seemed to have solved her problem.
When the girls came home from school they could not believe their eyes. They  thought the glasses looked very nice and wanted to hear all about them. Her husband thought the glasses looked terrific and liked them., and after talking to Karen was wondering if he should have his eyes examined as reading was getting more difficult.The girls did not like all this talk about glasses, they did not want them.
About a week later their dad came home proudly wearing his new glasses. They all thought he looked very handsome and distinguished wearing glasses.
Than he told them, because  he now realized how important eye exams were for overall health had made appointments for David and the twins for the following Saturday.
Saturday came and they all went to Jones Optical. David was first , his eyes were healthy and did not need glasses. That made the girls feel better.
Lindsay was next, she was myopic and needed to wear glasses. By sitting in the front of the class all the time did not realize her eyesight was bad.  Megan knew what was in store for her when she had tried Bryson s glasses in class, and would need glasses.
The girls had no choice but to select a frame that looked good. Their mother and the optician were very helpful, Megan selected a brown half frame , which looked nice on her. Lindsay did not care much, she was not going to wear glasses and selected a plain plastic frame.
While waiting for the glasses they went to the mall for refreshments . The girls were not very happy.
When they went to pick up their glasses the adjustment and fitting was done quickly and when the girls looked around did notice a big improvement in their vision.
Megan looked in the mirror and was surprised how good the glasses looked on her, and felt better.
Lindsay did not like the looks of glasses and was not going to wear them, she got along just fine before and did no want  them.
Megan wore her glasses on the way home and could not believe the improvement in her vision. Her parents complimented her on her good choice and the the glasses looked very nice on her., Lindsay refused to wear her glasses.
When on Monday Megan wore her glasses to school many of her class mates told her how good she looked wearing glasses.
Bryson told her she looked terrific, that is when Megan told him that when she tried his glasses knew she had to get her own.
Meagan started to enjoy wearing her glasses, she could see everything so much better , the glasses were comfortable, and had received many compliments on her new look.
Lindsay was stubborn and struggled along and would not wear glasses.</p>
<p>When Megan went to babysit at the Morgans, Marsha asked her if she would be interested in a part time job  at Jones Optical.
You look great wearing glasses have a pleasant personality and we have an opening for an optician assistant.Megan said she would love to and a couple of weeks later started her job. She liked the people she worked with and enjoyed helping customers selecting frames. With her improved vision  and her job that she loved, her grades at school improved noticeably.
Lindsay s parents were concerned about her refusal to wear glasses, she was a stubborn teenager and told her parents she was getting along just fie and was not going to spoil her looks wearing glasses .
Lindsay s father went to see Jim next door and told him he was concerned about Lindsay s refusal to wear glasses.
Jim suggested to send her back to see him for a check up and see if she could wear contact lenses.
Lindsay went back to Jones Optical and after a thorough examination Jim told her that her prescription in just 5 months had increased half a diopter  and since she was still growing might see another increase. She was not a candidate for contact lenses as her eyes were to dry. He suggested she just wear her glasses at school  and I know you are ready to get your drivers license and you wont get that unless you wear glasses. Lindsay was not happy, she hated the looks of her glasses. Megan suggested that working
at the optical shop would find her a real good looking frame to be made in her new prescription.
When Lindsay saw her new glasses and tried them on ,felt better she would just have to get used to wearing them., she also that more students were wearing glasses now.
Lindsay wore her glasses as Dr. Jim had suggested and realized he was right.
It did not take long for her to notice that when she took her glasses off everything looked fuzzy , and soon after wore her glasses all day like her sister.
Later that summer Jim and Marsha had a backyard barbeque   and invited the neighbors and some business friends.
Everybody enjoyed the nice summer afternoon. David Brown and Shelly were there[ see the receptionist] and were introduced to the Parker Family. Shelly talked to Megan and Lindsay about school and their jobs, and complimented them on their choice of glasses.and asked them if they would be interested in doing some modeling ? She told them they were planning a young peoples
fashion and health show,they would be showing stylish clothes and eye wear . They were also planning to have some health related exhibits as  dental, eye and hearing care. The plans were to have the show in the fall. The girls told Shelly that it sounded exiting and be glad to help out. Shelly told them she would be in touch as soon as the plans were finalized.</p>
<p>The show was going to be held near the food court in the mall, there was a large area available to have the show and some exhibits.
On the day of the show Jim Brown and Shelly had a large display of eyeglass frames and some of them were modeled by Lindsay and Megan. Marsha  of Jones Optical was there to answer questions of how to spot vision problems and about eye exams.
The dental and hearing exhibits were very informative and they all had lots of people looking and asking questions, the show was a success and everybody was pleased.
When the girls went back to school on Monday, they were complimented on the show, and a lot of kids told them they did not realize glasses were that cool, and were going to get their eyes examined. Lindsay and Megan were feeling very proud and Lindsay started to feel good about wearing glasses.
When they came home that night their mother told them that for their work at the show both received a gift certificate for a pair of their choice.
Megan and Lindsay were very happy about that , they would love an extra pair of glasses, they now loved wearing them.</p>
