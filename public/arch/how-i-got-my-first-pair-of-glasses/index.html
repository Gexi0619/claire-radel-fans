          <p>My problems started when I was 16</p>
<p>Even though I say it myself I&rsquo;m sure I was the prettiest  girl in our town,</p>
<p>It was a wonderful start to the summer I had just been crowned Beauty Queen, </p>
<p>I had started developing very early.Mum said I should buy a new bikini top,but I like my breasts showing over the top of it ha.
I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s why I won, but my friend Julie had put Cotton wool in hers.</p>
<p>We went to the cinema the next week. Robert wanted to sit in the back row, when the lights went out Robert started kissing me, then he started to try to put his hand up my blouse,that&rsquo;s when I slapped him.</p>
<p>I then realised why people sat in the back row, it was much to far away from the screen for people to see the movie </p>
<p>In the interval Robert left so I moved nearer to the front.</p>
<p>After the summer break, we returned to school. I sat at my normal desk in the back row. Why was the teacher writing so small this year?</p>
<p>After break we went into the Maths classroom.Had they got different chalk to write on the black board this year.was it an + or a -  maybe that&rsquo;s why I got so many wrong.</p>
<p>After lunch when we went back into the same classroom I said that there was cold air coming from the window so could I move. The teacher put me in the middle row, that was much better. She was writing much clearer than Mr Williams.</p>
<p>After Christmas we returned to school,as I walked into the classroom Mr Williams had already written things on the board. I went to sit in the middle row but his writing was so poor that before anybody else arrived I moved to the front row.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I met James, he was one of those nerds that studied hard and was top of the class,He was ok to talk to but his thick glasses were such a turnoff.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the start of the summer holiday,mum made be buy a new bikinis for the Beauty Queen competition,I had to Agree, as my old one only covered.my nipples</p>
<p>I won again, James Father was one of the Judges he came over afterwards, </p>
<p>“Hello Mary I think you are one of James friends, He says you sit next to him in the front row at school,He wonders why if you have such poor eyesight you don&rsquo;t get glasses”</p>
<p>I went scarlet.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need glasses. I have perfect eyesight its just because I feel the cold so it&rsquo;s warmer in the front of the class.</p>
<p>Part of the prize this year was a trip the the theatre.</p>
<p>Mr Jhonson said he had booked a box for us  and his wife and Janes would be acommany me.</p>
<p>It felt strange walking into the theatre Behind Mr and Mrs Johnson.and James beside me.</p>
<p>What must people think their beauty queen walking beside that nerd with thick glasses,</p>
<p>The lights went out ,suddenly my worst fears hit me, I could hear what they were saying  but the people were just small blurs</p>
<p>I must have been leaning forward and screwing my eyes up to try and see </p>
<p>I felt James touch my hands.</p>
<p>“Here, try these, they are my old pair of glasses.I brought  them with me. I thought they might help you..</p>
<p>Its dark so nobody would see you wearing them,</p>
<p>“Thank you James but in sure they will be much to strong for me”</p>
<p>“Shall I help you put them on? It&rsquo;s difficult if you have never worn glasses before.</p>
<p>I reluctantly nodded,I was sure they would be useless, so what would be the harm, I could thank him and take them straight off.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling as James started. hooking the cables over the back of my ears and I felt the heavy weight on my nose, I thought he said he had brought an old pair, not the last pair he had with those thick ugly lenses.</p>
<p>As I looked up I was shocked, everything was so clear,I only agreed to let him put them on me  because I was sure they would be useless</p>
<p>But now both he and I knew that I needed glasses!</p>
<p>As the curtain started to come down James lent over to me and took the glasses off me and put them in my bag.</p>
<p>“I hope they were a help you can keep them if you want to”</p>
<p>Strangely I did want to keep them but I didn&rsquo;t want anybody seeing me wearing them,especially tonight when I had my crown on.</p>
<p>Was James being so kind by removing my glasses before we went for refreshment in the interval or was I so ugly wearing them that even he could not look at me  wearing them.</p>
<p>As the second act started.James whispered.</p>
<p>“Are you going to put your glasses on.</p>
<p>I nodded and handed him my bag,</p>
<p>If I put them on myself I was admitting I needed glasses,but if he put them on I was only wearing them because he wanted me to. </p>
<p>I have to admit I could see so much better and I felt a little excitement as he hooked them over my ears </p>
<p>When the show was just finishing I asked James to take them off for me, I explained I was not ready to be seen wearing glasses.</p>
<p>He was very kind and understood.</p>
<p>As we were leaving the theatre Mr Jhonson asked me if I would like to join them tomorrow on a trip to London to look around the art galleries. It should help you and James in your art exams.</p>
<p>I did not like to refuse, also none of my friends would see me with James, so I would not be teased</p>
<p>As we arrived at my house Mrs Jhonson went into see My mother and asked if it was ok and unbeknown to me that we would be staying the weekend and they had booked me my own room.</p>
<p>As I was leaving in the morning Mother handed me my handbag .</p>
<p>“You had better take your new handbag with you, you can&rsquo;t use the old one”</p>
<p>I did not have time to protest as Mrs Jhonson was at the door.</p>
<p>Just before we arrived in the car park I decided to refresh my lipstick,that&rsquo;s when I realised I still had James old glasses in my bag.
I saw him looking with surprise at the glasses case.</p>
<p>If he really thought I had brought them with me on purpose he was badly mistaken , wearing them in the dark was one thing but in the daylight that was a no no.</p>
<p>I wanted to give them back to James,but if I did his father would wonder why they were in my bag.</p>
<p>At the art gallery James was busy writing so many notes </p>
<p>“How do you know so much about all these painting James”</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s all on the note boards over there it tells you all about each of the paintings” </p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m pleased you have have brought the glasses I gave you.but  why haven&rsquo;t you put them on”</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell him that  I had not meant to bring them.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m too shy to be seen wearing them James”</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want anybody seeing me, it&rsquo;s ok for you to wear such  thick glasses but I&rsquo;m a Beauty Queen”</p>
<p>“Could  you see better at the theatre  with them”</p>
<p>“Yes of course I could you know that”</p>
<p>“Do you want to pass your exams”</p>
<p>“Yesss don&rsquo;t ask silly questions”</p>
<p>“So come here”</p>
<p>James took hold of my handbag and took the glasses case out,</p>
<p>I then felt this strange sensation as he was hooking the temple cables over my ears. Suddenly I could see the writing on the boards, before I didn&rsquo;t even know there we&rsquo;re boards there.</p>
<p>“You look even more beautiful Mary”</p>
<p>“That&rsquo;s kind of you James ,but I don&rsquo;t feel beautiful”</p>
<p>We had a lovely time looking at all the paintings. James was very kind and good company.he seemed more interested in me not just the size of my breasts.</p>
<p>When James suggested we have lunch I was surprised how fast the morning had gone,normally by lunch time I have very bad headaches,but not today.</p>
<p>I went to the lady&rsquo;s room,that&rsquo;s when I first saw myself wearing glasses,I had TOTALLY forgotten I was wearing them,</p>
<p>Was that really me, the round metal tortoiseshell frames dominate my face how could I possibly be seeing through those THICK lens ,also why did my eyes look so small now </p>
<p>I pulled the glasses down a little and peered over the top. My reflection in the mirror seemed to instantly turn into a blur.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day sightseeing,it was soon going to be time to meet James Parents for our evening meal,I asked James if he would take my glasses off for me as I did not want his parents seeing me wearing his old glasses.</p>
<p>He is such a kind person he did not question me,.</p>
<p>“I think you should put a little makeup on to cover the red mark on your nose Mary, then my parents won&rsquo;t no you been wearing glasses all day”</p>
<p>We had a lovely evening meal,I had to admit to myself that I did miss wearing James glasses. It was much harder to see across the table, I excused myself early as I suddenly got one of my very bad headaches again </p>
<p>Next morning we were up early,
Today we were going to visit some of the museums. As soon as we got outside, I instantly realised I should be wearing the glasses James gave me</p>
<p>I held James hand while we crossed the road, as we got to the other side I stopped and turned to James.</p>
<p>“Would you mind if I wore your old glasses again today, it feels strange without them”</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s fine Mary,what you mean is you can&rsquo;t see without them  they are your now that&rsquo;s why I gave them to you”</p>
<p> I smiled ,Yes he was correct .I now had to accept that I needed to wear glasses all the time  the problem was the thickness of the lens.</p>
<p>He had just said they were mine now.</p>
<p>I nervously took them out of their case, this was the first time I had ever held a pair of glasses,they certainly were very heavy and the lens very thick.</p>
<p>For the very first time I nervously hooked the metal hooks over my ears and lower the heavy glasses onto my nose</p>
<p>I could see James smiling at me.</p>
<p>“You still look just as beautiful Mary”</p>
<p>He gave me a little kiss on my check and had said I looked beautiful while looking at my glasses, not just  my breasts.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful day just as we were on our way Back to the hotel, a voice behind said.</p>
<p>“Hi you two, have you had a good day”</p>
<p>I turned around and it was James parents
Mrs Jhonson smiled at me”</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m pleased you have decided to wear your glasses all the time now dear. They look very nice on you. I  first noticed you were wearing them in the theatre the other night  </p>
<p>“James&rsquo; father is an optician. I suggest you go and get an eye test tomorrow. Maybe choose a paler colour”</p>
<p>Just before my mother opened the door I quickly took the glasses off.</p>
<p>Next morning I told my mother I was going to see Mr Jhonson for an eye test as I was getting a lot of headaches and he thought I might need glasses.</p>
<p>“ Don&rsquo;t be silly Mary, I&rsquo;m sure you have perfect eyesight but if you want to go it&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>Mr Jhonson told me to sit in this big chair and asked me which letter I could read.</p>
<p>“Im sorry I can&rsquo;t read any of them”</p>
<p>He then put these strange glasses on me,</p>
<p>“Let&rsquo;s see how you manage with the prescription that is in the glasses James lent you.</p>
<p>After lots of different lens were tried in, Mr Jhonson decided he was happy with what I could see for now but I had to return in 3 months</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Mary I don&rsquo;t know how you have possibly managed or so long without glasses  Your eyesight is even worse than James, you have a very much higher astigmation then he does,</p>
<p>“Is that why I have had such bad headache when I have been studying for the last 3 years”</p>
<p>“Yes Mary,also you now have latent myopia</p>
<p>“It will take a few days to get the 2 pairs of glasses you need”</p>
<p>“Will my lens be thinner than James, </p>
<p>“No I&rsquo;m sorry Mary,as I said you have a higher astigmation than James”</p>
<p>“YOU mean they are going to be even THICKER  THAN THE  NEW ONES JAMES IS WEARING NOW”</p>
<p>“Why do I need 2 pairs Mr Jhonson, I will be careful not to break them”</p>
<p>Mr Jhonson smiled </p>
<p>“No Mary I&rsquo;m giving you a separate pair for reading,</p>
<p>“Oooo I don&rsquo;t think I like that”</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s not really about what you like it&rsquo;s what you need that matters”</p>
<p>“If you wait a few minutes we will pop the lens out of the frame that James gave you and fit them in a pink version, then your mother won&rsquo;t know you have been wearing James glasses, you can tell her they are a temporary pair for you to get used to wearing glasses”</p>
<p>When James saw me wearing the pink frames he gave me a big kiss, it was the first of many times that our thick lens crashed together. We Both laughed.</p>
<p>When I walked in the house my mother was shocked to see me wearing glasses.</p>
<p>“What are you wearing those dreadful things for Mary, the lens look nearly as thick as James”</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t tell her they were James lens ha,</p>
<p>“They are just temporary glasses mum I get my correct lens in 2 weeks time”</p>
<p>“O that&rsquo;s a relief I thought you were going to have to wear those ugly lens”</p>
<p>2 weeks later we returned to collect my new glasses, this time it was me that was shocked.</p>
<p>They were in the same type of pink frame But the lens were even thicker than I had expected</p>
<p>Then the lady took the other pair out,this time the frames were the same style ,but black,and the lens had lines running from top the bottom </p>
<p>We went back to James house to do some studying.</p>
<p>“Why don&rsquo;t you put your new reading glasses on Mary”</p>
<p>“Ok but will you put them on for me”</p>
<p>I always love it when James hooks my glasses arms over my ears.
for me.</p>
<p>The black print on the pages suddenly looked bigger and clearer.</p>
<p>James kissed me and said you look very pretty.</p>
<p>I went over  to the door and turned the lock</p>
<p>I took hold of James&rsquo; hand and guided it into my bra, this time I wanted my breasts to be played with.</p>
<p>His soft warm hands felt wonderful as he touched my nipples.</p>
<p>“JAMES Please make me yours”</p>
<p>When I got home my mother nearly fainted when I walked into the house with my new glasses on.</p>
<p>“O Mary you can&rsquo;t be seen wearing those dreadful things, please take them off now”</p>
<p>I ran up to my bedroom </p>
<p>About an hour later Mother knocked on my door. I have brought your bedtime drink.</p>
<p>As she put it on the table she saw my pink glasses there.</p>
<p>“O that&rsquo;s a good girl Mary, I&rsquo;m glad you listened to me and took your glasses off”</p>
<p>As I turned my mother nearly fainted I had my black reading glasses on </p>
<p>“MARY why are you wearing those dreadful  glasses with the black frames,  what are all those lines on your lens”</p>
<p>“They TOTALLY spoil your looks”</p>
<p>“They are my reading glasses Mother they help keeping my eyes straight while I&rsquo;m reading,and stop me getting headaches”</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m sorry mother you are going to have to get used to me wearing glasses ALL the time from now onwards”</p>
<p>Over the next 3 years my prescription kept changing and the lens got thicker and thicker. 
James has nearly qualified as an optician,</p>
<p>Then I got a letter from a modelling agency.
They had remembered seeing me when I won the beauty competition and would like me to come for an interview.</p>
<p>At first I was overjoyed but then as I took my reading glasses off and replaced my heavy thick distance glasses back on, my heart sunk.</p>
<p>I want to talk to James farther he said that my eyesight was to bad for contact lens and advise me against LASIK surgery as it was in its early days</p>
<p>When I told James I wanted surgery we had a big argument, and I stormed out.</p>
<p>I did miss James but I also wanted to be a model</p>
<p>A few weeks later went to another optician and they fitted me with these hard contact lens that covered my whole eyes, it was so difficult putting them in also they did not fully correct my vision but at least I could see to walk down the catwalk wearing them 
They were very painful but I managed to wear them for a few hours modelling.but I was always getting an infection.</p>
<p>A year later I was walking down the high street when I saw the sign for eye surgery, without a second thought I went in and booked it.</p>
<p>2 weeks later a friend came with me. I paid the money and put the gown on.</p>
<p>The operation was more painful than I had expected, I left the surgery with both eyes bandaged and told to rest at home.</p>
<p>After 2 days the pain got worse so my friend rang the clinic but there was no reply,so she took me to the hospital.</p>
<p>I heard a familiar voice</p>
<p>“How are you Mary what has happened to you”</p>
<p>It was James he was now working at the hospital </p>
<p>I started crying as I explained what I had done.he sounded worried when I explain were I had the surgery </p>
<p>He turned the lights off and removed my bandages</p>
<p>He put some drops in my eye to relieve the pain before replacing the bandages</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t think you should be on your own tonight Would you like to come home with me, I live above my father shop now,and I can put more drops in your eyes later and give you a full eye test tomorrow the shop is closed on Sunday”</p>
<p>It was a nice feeling holding James warm hands again as we walked to the car.</p>
<p>Twice during the night he knocked on the door and came into the bedroom and put more drops in my eyes before replacing the bandages</p>
<p>Next morning after breakfast he helped me downstairs.</p>
<p>I heard him turn the light off before he removed the bandages
He then shone this bright light in my eyes.</p>
<p>I felt him hooking the test frames over my ears and adding lens into the holders.</p>
<p>Why was he doing that I had just had surgery and they promised me perfect eyesight </p>
<p>I was relieved when he turned  the light up a little and I could read some of the letter on the wall.</p>
<p>As he changed the lens I could read some smaller letters.</p>
<p>“If you keep these test frames on I will go into the basement and make you a new pair of glasses”</p>
<p>“But they said I would not be shortsighted any more and not need glasses”</p>
<p>“Well yes that is what should&rsquo;ve happened” but they seem to have had a problem”</p>
<p>“You are no longer short sighted” </p>
<p>“Wow that&rsquo;s good, so why do you say you are going to make me a pair of glasses”</p>
<p>“The problem is that you are now long sighted”</p>
<p>“You mean I won&rsquo;t have tiny little eyes peering out of the flat fronted lens any  more ,So that&rsquo;s good”</p>
<p>And hour later I felt James hooking the cables over my ears,
Then the heavy weight on my nose,</p>
<p>As I looked in the mirror I SCREAMED .</p>
<p>These 2 ENORMOUSLY BIG eyes were just staring at me though these thick bulging lenses </p>
<p>I was crying and screaming uncontrollably</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m so sorry what a stupid thing I have done please forgive me James”</p>
<p>James dried my eyes and gave me a big hug,”let&rsquo;s go out for lunch, and talk about our future dear”</p>
<p>Everything seemed so different now,looking through these thick bulging plus lenses.they were so much heavier than the minus lens I had worn for years</p>
<p>James was so kind and had fitted the plus lens in large pink plastic NHS frames.which were much nicer.but I still I felt so self conscious  wearing them ,It was even worse than the day I first wore glasses at the art gallery. </p>
<p>“Why do you keep staring at me James do I look so ugly now”</p>
<p>“I have missed you darling Mary.you look even more beautiful now.i love your big blue eyes dear.i always thought it was a shame they looked so small before.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m Going to take over father business soon”</p>
<p>“Will you Marry me and come and work as my receptionist?</p>
<p>Today is our first day working together,we have refurbished the shop.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk ready to greet our first client.</p>
<p>I felt so confident wearing my new plus 40 glasses with a telescopic lens fitted so I could see to read with my right eye.</p>
<p> </p>
