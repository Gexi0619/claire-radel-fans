          <p>Now, both sisters need, and love, wearing their glasses.</p>
<p>What an experience, to move from the farm to the city.
Linda is my name, I was born and raised on the farm, but after finishing high school, moved to town, because there are no jobs at home, unless I do house work for somebody,
I am a well build girl, with lovely hair, and consider my self attractive,.
I am planning on taking some night courses at the university in t he city, I want to broaden my knowledge..</p>
<p>I just came of the bus, and plan on staying at the Y.W.C.A.
After staying at the Y.W.C.A. . for a few nights, I located a place to live.
With the money I had, was able to rent a room, and started to look for employment.</p>
<p>My first job was in a small restaurant, the pay was low, but with the tips, I got was enough to live on, at least, I had a job, and enough money coming in, to pay the rent, and save a little.
I started at 7, in the morning serving breakfast, then served coffee til lunch time, next serve lunch, and
I was finished at 2 in the afternoon
In the afternoon, I went to look around, to familiarize myself with everything in the area where I lived.,
I located the library, and now know, where to get some good reading material.
For the first time in my life, visited a large shopping mall.
I went into almost every store, to look around, and then had some refreshments, at the food court.
While sitting there, I noticed some more stores, that I had not seen yet.</p>
<p>After finishing her refreshments, Linda decided to visit the other stores.
She walked past the optical store, no use going in there, I don&rsquo;t need glasses. and I am not interested ,
so I did not go into shop,
She changed her mind when she saw a sign in the window, afternoon part time help wanted.
That would be great, I have every afternoon free, why not find out about it.</p>
<p>When I walked into the Optical Store, for the first time in my life, could not believe my eyes, so many glasses on display.
I looked around, but did not dare touch the glasses, when a glasses wearing lady came over and greeted me..
Hello, can I help you?
Would you like to try some of the frames, I have some here, that will look great on you, and handed me a frame, please try it, I am sure you will love, and see how nice you will look.</p>
<p>Linda, who was brought up, to always be nice to people, did not dare refuse and put the glasses on.
Here is a mirror, so you can have a good look at yourself.
When I had a good look at myself, could not believe how good and different, I looked wearing glasses.
Well, how do you like the glasses?
I had never thought, I can look this good wearing glasses, but I did not come in to buy glasses, I saw your sign, part time help wanted.
That is great, come along I will take you to the manager.</p>
<p>Linda , still wearing the glasses, asked the lady where do you want the glasses?
I like you to keep them on wearing them, you look so nice.
Then the lady, asked Linda to sit down, she would be right back.
Linda in the meantime, could not believe she was searing glasses, they were very comfortable, and every time she looked at herself, could not believe how good she looked, she liked that look.</p>
<p>The lady, went into an office, to talk to the manager.,and said to him, I think the right kind of girl, is applying for the part time position, she is very attractive, and looks beautiful wearing glasses. about a minute later both came out of the office.
Hello, I am John Smith, and you are?
Glad to meet you, Mr Smith, I am Linda Watson.
Come in to my office please, so we can talk, and please sit down.
Linda followed Mr. Watson, and sat down.
They discussed the job, and what was expected of her, and told her, he would like to see her wearing her glasses, to show customers, how attractive a young lady can look wearing glasses.
Mr. Smith, the glasses are not mine.
I know, but they will be, we give you an eye exam first, in case you need a prescription, and I think you look fantastic wearing glasses,, and we would like you to wear them.
After discussing, her salary, he asked Linda, would you like to work here?
Yes, thank you, I will be glad to work for you.
Welcome to our optical store.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Linda was given an eye exam, the lady optometrist was very pleasant, and Linda really enjoyed her first eye exam, and found it very interesting, and asked many questions.
Linda found the eye business very interesting, and sure would like to know more about it.
When the exam was finished, the optometrist told Linda, that she was myopic, and had some astigmatism, and explained it all to Linda, and showed her the difference of what she would see wearing, and not wearing glasses, then handed her a prescription, which read, O.D.-1.00,
and O.S.-1.25 .</p>
<p>The optician took the prescription, and explained to Linda what all the figures meant..
We will get this frame made up for you, and the glasses will be ready for you, when you come in to-morrow.
Linda was excited, a new job, and nice glasses, she really liked, her looks when wearing the glasses .</p>
<p>Linda, on her way home, went to the library, and found some books about eyes and vision, she did not have a computer yet, and wanted to learn more about eyes and glasses.
.</p>
<p>The next day, she started her job at the optical store.
When she arrived, the optician, asked her to sit down, and handed her the glasses.
Linda put the glasses on, and when she looked around, could not believe the improvement in her vision, everything she looked at, looked so nice and clear, she had never realized her vision was not perfect.
She felt all aroused, what a wonderful feeling, to be able to see so well, and the glasses were so comfortable to wear, she loved it.</p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon, she was shown the routine work that had to be done, and how to book appointments..
After work she went home, to eat and phone her mother, to tell her all the news.</p>
<p>The next morning wearing her new glasses, she went to work, at the restaurant, and received many compliments on her new look, and was sure, she had received more in tips.</p>
<p>Linda was very happy, with the 2 jobs going, she was making enough money, to save some, because she wanted to get more education.
She loved her job at the optical store so much, that she wanted to learn more about vision and glasses.
She checked the night courses, at the university, and noticed a part time course, to become an optician.
A 3 year course of, 2 nights, and one afternoon of practical studies, a week..
Perfect, that is what she wanted, she discussed it with her employer, who told her they were all for it.</p>
<p>Linda, soon, did most of the pre. exam routines, and assisting customers, selecting new frames.
Because it is only a few weeks before school starts again, there were more school age customers.
I love this job, and I am looking forward, to start my opticians course, at the university.</p>
<p>Linda sure was busy, her course her course had started, and not much time for homework, there was a lot to learn, and Linda wanted good marks., because she knew the answers, when she had her exams.</p>
<p>Time goes fast, and Linda finished her last year, of her opticians course. and passed with honours,
and received her license, as a registered optician, and contact lens fitter.</p>
<p>Linda now is a full time optician, and works full time. and has her own apartment.</p>
<p>Because Linda, had done so well after moving to the city, her younger sister Megan, asked her if she
could come and live with her, of course Linda told her to come.</p>
<p>Megan, who looked a lot like Linda, moved in with her. and started to work at the restaurant where Linda had worked., and liked the job.
Megan, being home early in the afternoon, was rummaging in the apartment, looking for a pair of sock, instead of socks, found, Linda&rsquo;s old glasses.
She loved Linda&rsquo;s glasses look, so she tried wearing the glasses, and found that the one pair, that she really liked the looks of, and when she tried them was really surprised, about the improvement in her vision.
Looking around, right away, noticed how everything looked so nice and clear, she loved it.
She went over to a mirror to have a look at herself, and loved her glasses wearing look,
No wonder Linda likes wearing glasses.</p>
<p>Megan decided to go for a walk, wearing the glasses., and could not believe, that wearing glasses,
made everything so much nicer to look at.
The next day, when she went to work at the restaurant, serving breakfast, customers remarked how she nice she looked, wearing glasses, and that she sure looks a lot like Linda.
When her shift was fished, Megan kept wearing the glasses, she loved them, and would ask Linda about them, when she comes home.</p>
<p>Megan in the meantime, looked around to find an afternoon job, she had all this time, and felt guilty just bumming around.
She decided to go to the mall, the fall season was coming, and some store might be looking for help.
When she arrived at the mall, looked in every store window, if there might be a sign, help wanted.</p>
<p>Megan was lucky, there was a sign in a lady&rsquo;s fashion store,
The manager of he store liked Megan, and complimented, her on how nice she looked wearing glasses, and told Megan, she liked the more mature glasses look., and that she could start the next day
.It was a part time position, with some afternoon and evening hours.
Megan told the lady, she would be there the next day.
When Megan left the store, went to the food court, and had some refreshments.
Now? what to do about the glasses, she had completely forgotten she was wearing them, and the lady liked her to wear the glasses.</p>
<p>No need, to worry about it, because who came to the food court for her afternoon break, Linda.
Megan figured, she might as well get done with it, and greeted Linda.
When she came over asked Megan, where did you get the glasses.
Sorry Linda, I was looking for a pair of socks, and I looked in your dresser drawer, and spotted the glasses,.
I was curious what tit was like wearing glasses, and when I tried them, could see so well,,and I liked the way the way I looked, and they were so comfortable, that I kept wearing the glasses, and I just got a job, at a lady&rsquo;s fashion store, partly because the manager, liked my glasses look, the glasses made me look more mature.</p>
<p>Linda, told Megan, come with me to the optical store.
Megan did not there argue., Linda did not sound to happy.</p>
<p>When they were in the store, Linda introduced her sister to the optician, who commented on Megan&rsquo;s look
Linda spoke to the optician, and I did not hear what they said, all I heard was, sure go ahead.
Megan followed Linda into a small room,, where she was asked to sit down.
Linda performed all the pre exam routine and looked at the print out, and the glasses prescription. Then she gave the glasses back to Megan, and told her she could wear them.
The print out of the prescription, was almost identical, to the glasses prescription.
You can wear the glasses, but after wearing them for a few months, you should have a proper eye exam.
Megan was delighted, she loved wearing the glasses, she could see properly, and liked the way, she looked wearing them. Linda was really surprised, that Megan , had an identical presciption as sh had at when she started, to wear glasses
Now, both sisters, need, and love wearing their glasses.
