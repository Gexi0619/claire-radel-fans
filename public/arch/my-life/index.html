          <p>MY LIFE
true or fantasyÂ </p>
<p>I have always had a interest in girls wearing glasses and hearing aids.I looked forward with anticipation to the start of a new term at school to see how many girls would be sitting nearer the front or have a glasses case next to their pencil case..
In England glasses and hearing aids were provided free by the governments NHS service, only 2 styles were available round metal or or oblong plastic in 5 colours.
Many girls did not want to be seen wearing them.also there were no mobile phones so it very rare to see a girl wearing plus glasses,
Nowadays there seems to be as many girls being full time plus lens wearers as minus.
Strange those same styles are the big fashions now.</p>
<p>After leaving school I never dated a girl for more than a week if she was not a glasses wearer or a squinting girl.
First date would be a coffee shop,then if it went ok.
The next would be the back row of the cinema,not for snogging but for her eye test,
If she seemed to be squinting I would say.
Why don&rsquo;t you put your glasses on dear you will enjoy the film more and I&rsquo;m sure you will look even pretty wearing them
Then I waited in anticipation would she open her bag and take out a glasses case and shyly put them on,
We&rsquo;re they round style with temple hooks or the plastic frames and what colour would they be.
After the film finished I would quickly grab her hand and say let&rsquo;s get out before they play the national Anthem or we will be here forever,hopefully not giving her time to find her glasses case in the bottom of her handbag.
As soon as we were outside I would give her a passionate kiss then say you look even more beautiful with your glasses, please keep them onÂ </p>
<p>Or would she .say I&rsquo;m ok I&rsquo;m fine I don&rsquo;t need glasses then it was time for my second test</p>
<p>Would you like to learn to drive?
If she said yesÂ 
Then you will need to get a driving licence,can you read that number plate that&rsquo;s the first part of the driving test.</p>
<p>If she failed this test I would sugest I will come with you tomorrow and we can get your eyes teste
Then I had the pleasure of seeing her coming out of the testing room holding a piece of paper,and helping her choose the frames,and few days later being the first person to see her wearing glasses,sometimes I would arrive a little early and ask the receptionist to suggest that my friend should wear her glasses full time to get used to them.Â </p>
<p>If these not work then No third test, Â would put her on the bus and say I have to start work early tomorrowÂ </p>
<p>As time went by I got married and of course my wife wore glasses.
I had become friends with my local optician and always made sure that he would prescribe the highest prescription my wife&rsquo;s could manage without her knowing, and the new glasses were fitted with C39 lens.
It was not long before mobile phones started to get smaller,and one day while talking to the optician I sugest that my wife might need bifocals, he understood what I was meaning.
So 2 weeks later when we went for her test he upped her prescription as much as he could for distance then gave her a card with small writing on it and held it very close for her to read, to my delight she could not read it that close,so I heard the magic words I think you need bifocals now.
After 3 hours my wife was walking out of the shop with even thicker lens and the sun sparkling off the D28 bifocal lines on her new glasses,</p>
<p>2 years later we left the opticians my wife was now wearing new glasses again with much thicker lens and the sun sparkling off the 2 lines of her D35 trifocals
.
Later that year I was sitting in a coffee shop when I notice this attartive lady at the table next to me obviously she was wearing glasses or I would not have given her a second look,but what was that behind her ears.Â 
Was this young lady deaf.
I lent towards her and quietly said âit&rsquo;s very nice coffee they serve here , she replied âcould you repeat it please I&rsquo;m rather deafâÂ 
Then she beckoned me to sit next to her,l apologized and asked if I could buy her another coffee and cake,I complimented her on her glasses âthank you she said they are rather old I am getting a eye test at the weekend,I find it very difficult to drive at night nowâ
âPlease call me Aliceâ(I thought it would be nice to see my wife wearing hearing aids as well as her glasses ) It was not long before I managed to ask her about her hearing.she told me that she starting wearing one hearing aid about 5 years ago and earlier this year she got 2 new models.she slowly took both of her hearing aids out and showed me.
I said I thought my wife had a hearing problem but would not go for a test.
We&rsquo;re could I go to buy a hearing aid for her?
âI don&rsquo;t know she said but if you buy me lunch same time next week I will bring my older hearing aid and you can let her try itâÂ </p>
<p>The week passed by very quickly,so the same time the following week I arrived at the restaurant next to the coffee shop,a few minutes later Alice arrived,as she sat down I noticed she had new glasses on,I commented on how nice they looked
She said âthank you I expect you noticed the lens are strange they have these 2 small circle in the middle my sight is getting much worse,just like my hearing.
The waiter arrived with the menuâ Alice said I must try my reading glasses I Only Got them this morning.âI can&rsquo;t see to read the menuâ
When she put her reading glasses on I noticed how much thicker the lens were.
âThat&rsquo;s so much easier to read the menu now, I was getting double vision before. they told me I need prisms in my reading glasses,do you mind if I keep them onâ?
She put her distance glasses back into the empty case she then got this small box out of her handbag,she opened it and took a pink hearing aid out, âthis is my older hearing aid I know it&rsquo;s larger than the ones I&rsquo;m wearing now but you are welcome to borrow itâ.
âI have taken my mould off and fitted it with this universal fitting I will show you how it fitsâ taking out her new aid she hands me her older hearing aid and said âjust push that part into my ear and hook the aid over my earâ,my hands were shaking with excitement.,
âYou see it&rsquo;s very easy to fitâ
Taking it out she said âlean over here and I will put it in your ear and you can wear it while we eat our mealâas she fitted it into my ears I could feel my trousers getting tighter.
After we had finished our meal I put the hearing aid back in the small box and thanked Alice, we arrange to meet the same time next weekÂ </p>
<p>I had been working out how I could get my wife to try the hearing aid,so during the last week I had been changing the volume setting on the TV turning it down just a little each day,
Last night I had noticed she had moved her chair a little forward nearer Â to the TV.
When I got home that evening our meal was ready,after we had eaten,my wife started loading the dishwasher, I said shall I make coffee and take it into the lounge.
As soon as I got into the lounge I pushed my wife&rsquo;s chair further back.
Then I turned the TV on and sat down to drink my coffee,
âCan you turn the sound up please dearâshe said,
Just what I was hoping for.
I said to her I noticed you seem to be having a problem hearing the TV dear, so I spoke to one of my colleagues at work who wears hearing aids and she lent me her spare hearing aid for you to try.
âWhy do I want that thing she repliedâ
Well you do seem to have a problem hearing the TV dear.
Let me fit it in for you and then you can try it.
âI really don&rsquo;t what that thing in my ear stop itâ
Just try it it won&rsquo;t no any harm.
âI&rsquo;m not having one of those things in all the time,you can take it back tomorrowâ
As I fitted into her ears I could feel my trousers getting tight at the front and my pants felt damp.
When we went to bed she said will you take thing out of my ear please I don&rsquo;t like it in my ear. .
The same thing happened the next night, as she turned the TV on I went a gotÂ 
the hearing aid,and said here you are dear let me put it in for you,
âI told you to take that backâ
I thought it helped you.
âO if you must Â just put the thing in Then and let&rsquo;s watch the programâ.
The next night I turned the TV on,my wife said you had better go and get that thing ,or you will only start going on about it and spoil the start of the programÂ 
The following evening I turn the TV on and pick the hearing aid up and much to my surprise as I went to put it in her ear there was not objection,the next 3 nights were the same.
It was Saturday and we were going shopping.my wife said will you clean my glasses for me,I went into the bedroom and got the glasses cloth and the hearing aid.i love the feeling of the trifocal lines on the thick lens.Â 
After I had cleaned her glasses I put them on for her, and started to put the hearing aid in.
âWHAT are you doingâshe said, âStop it I&rsquo;m not wearing that thing outsideâ.
I thought it be a good idea if you wore the hearing aid shopping ,it did seem to help listen to the TV.
âI don&rsquo;t need that thing in my ear outside it only the TV I need it forâ(wow the word need it was said )Â 
âI REALLY don&rsquo;t want that in my ear,take it outâ
It&rsquo;s in now dear,just try it please dear.
âI suppose we will have an argument if I don&rsquo;t wear it ,but If you insist, we have to go to the other town I don&rsquo;t want to be seen wearing itâ.
I made sure I was always on the side she was wearing her hearing aid I had fitted it in her right ear as that was the side her eyesight was worse she had minus 15 lens with an add of 2 for middle distance and add of 4 for readings so this was the thickest lens in her glasses.and the trifocal lines were very noticeableÂ 
I had waited till she had put her hair up before fitting the hearing aid in so it was very conspicuous.
We went in to Mcdonalds for lunch, my wife said you seem very happy shopping today, you normally complain and want to get home.
Its nice that you seem to hear so well with the hearing aid in dear it makes life less stressful not having to repeat things.
âUm I suppose it helps a littleâ
The next morning after breakfast my wife said have you finished in the shower, were did you put my old bifocals I want to wear them in the shower it&rsquo;s so difficult to see now without glasses.
After she had Â put her hair up and finished her makeup,she said can you get my trifocals I want to wear them in church, I got them from the bedside table and picked the hearing aid up as well.
When she had put her glasses on I said stand still while I fit your hearing aid in.
âO have I got to wear that to church as wellâ.
Much to my surprise and delightment she did not object to much.
Was my wife now a hearing aid wearer as well as a high myopic lady.</p>
<p>When I went to work on Monday my wife was still in bed,I said âdon&rsquo;t forget I have booked a table tonight for my birthday.shall we meet there about 6pmâ
Later That day I meet Alice at lunch time as we had arrangedÂ 
She said âI noticed you wife was wearing my hearing aid on Saturday I was behind you in the que at McDonald&rsquo;sâ
Yes I said I. Sorry I did not see you.
âI hope you don&rsquo;t mind but I bought 2 hearing aids for your wife on eBay.they only cost 300 for the two.you can pay me next week if you want them.and this is the website in the USA that will make moulds like mineâ.
âThey are the same models as my old one,so if you want you can change the one I lent you for this one, and then you have a spare for your wife or maybe you find a way of getting her to wear 2 like meâ
âHere let me fit them in your ears then you can try them while we have our lunch,wait a minute while I put my reading glasses onâher hands were shaking and I could see her heart beating faster as she lent close to me and slowly fitted the hearing aids into my ears, we said nothing we just looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes I could now see that she had many prism rings in her reading glasses.
When we had finished our lunch we arranged to meet the same time next week so I could give Alice her spare hearing aid backÂ 
As soon as I got back to work I looked on the web site that Alice had told me about and ordered the kits for 2 full shell moulds.
I was a little late arriving at the restaurant,my wife was already there sitting at the table I had booked as I walked up behind her I noticed she was wearing her hearing aid.I gave her a kiss and said you look beautiful tonight.
O is that because I&rsquo;m wearing my hearing aid ,it&rsquo;s your birthday and I know you like me wearing itâ
I went red
I sat down and started to speak in a quieter voice.
Twice she asked me to repeat what I had said then she saidÂ 
âCan you come and sit this side pleaseâshe said pointing to her right side
My plan was working.
Later I thanked my wife for a lovely evening</p>
<p>Saturday soon arrived,and I suggested that instead of going shopping why don&rsquo;t we go to London sightseeing and go to a show after.
I went on the internet and booked tickets for a show.while my wife got ready
When she came out of the bedroom,she saidâhow do I turn my hearing aid up a little,When you were sitting on my left side at the restaurant I found it hard to hear youâ
Wait a minute I said
When I returned I explained that I have to give the hearing Aid back that I had borrowed.
She looked a little disappointed.
I know I didn&rsquo;t want to wear it but I have to admit it does help.
I then said that I had seen a special offer,so I had bought her new ones for her.
âThat was kind of youâ she said.
As she opened the box I said the offer was buy one get the second Â half price.
âThey look much nicer she said they a brighter colourâ
That fits nice dear.
I then went around to her left side and lowered my voice and said do you want a coffee dear,
âCan you repeat please dear I can&rsquo;t hear as well when you are on that side can you show me how to turn my hearing aid upâ
Ok dear.
Oo I just had a thought why don&rsquo;t you try the spare hearing aid in your left ear instead of turning the volume up.
âUm I don&rsquo;t think so, I don&rsquo;t want to be seen wearing hearing aids in both ears,people will think I&rsquo;m a old womanâ
You are to pretty to look like a old woman,and we are going to London so people won&rsquo;t know you,and It might help at the theatre.
âDo you really want me to âAre you sure you not mind being seen with me like thatâ?
âYou had better put in in for me to try now before we go outâ
I have set them both on number 2 dear how is that.
âThat is very good I can hear much better on that side now,can you turn the right up a littleâ
That&rsquo;s number 3 now.
âYes that much betterâ
I have bought you a kit to take impressions of the inside of your ears so we can order you full shell Â moulds,they will fit better and if you need to turn them up they won&rsquo;t whistle.and you can choose the colour.
Â As she went to look in the mirror it was the first time I had seen her from behind.they did show a lot more than the ones Alice now wore,but I found it very exciting.Â 
We had a wonderful time in London and the show was very good and my wife even said that she could hear everything so well now.</p>
<p>The next morning my wife was up first Â when I walked into the kitchen she was bending down putting the chicken in the oven,much to my suprise and delightment she had put both hearing aids in.Â 
I said do you want tea or coffee.
âYou don&rsquo;t need to shout I have decided to wear both hearing aids all the time now,I enjoyed hearing so well at the theatre, and I know you find me more sexy wearing them.</p>
<p>Wednesday soon arrived and I was looking forward to my what had become a weekly meeting with Alice,
âNice to see you againâ Alice I saidÂ 
I have brought your spare hearing aid with me
âThank youâÂ 
As I handed her the boxÂ 
Alice said â I have booked us the private room I thought it be nice to eat on our ownâÂ 
As soon as we sat down she opened her handbag and took out her reading glasses case,
âWould you like to take my glasses off for me and put my reading glasses on ,mind my hearing aids don&rsquo;t whistleâ
As I opened the case I was surprised how heavy they were,I slowly took her glasses off,without her glasses on Alice&rsquo;s eye seemed much bigger but very sunken.my hands were shaking as I placed the reading glasses on her nose.Alice then took another box out and said Will you wear these hearing aid for me while we have lunch? It will be so nice to not be the only person wearing hearing aids.â
Yes of course if that makes you happy.</p>
<p>I loved the look of her reading glasses, as she came close to me the edge of the Â right lens was so much thicker and seemed to have much more prism correction than I had noticed last week,
As she fitted the hearing aids in my ears she was breathing very fast her hands were trembling
She then opened bag again and took another larger box out and saidâI had my hearing tested again last week,and as I expected it has got evenÂ 
worse, I collected my new hearing aids on the way here,they are much more powerful that&rsquo;s why they so big. I wanted you to be the first person to see me wearing them,will you put them in for me?
In it were two much larger hearing aids with strange attachments fitted to them and purple ear moulds.
Suddenly she picked up her glasses with the Myodisc lens and placed them on my nose I could just see a little thought the small circles,
âThat is how I see without glasses she whisperedâ
I was so excited I gently removed her left hearing aid and fitted the new one,then as I started to remove her right hearing aid I felt a hand under the table,she was frantically unzipping my trouser, I had just fitted the other aid in, and was just putting my hand under the table ,when the waiter knock on the door and brought the main course in,
We were both eating our meal with one hand and wearing glasses and hearing aidsÂ 
When it was time to go Â Alice took her Myodisc glasses off of me and I took her reading glasses off of her.
As we left âAlice said I have to go away for a month,can we meet as soon as I get backâshe looked around to see if any body was there and gave me a passionate kiss.
As I was just opening my house door I suddenly remembered I Still had the hearing aids in I quickly took them out Â put them in the box.</p>
<p>About 2 weeks later as we went to get in the car,my wife âsaid can you drive,I&rsquo;m suddenly finding it hard to see to drive at night,I think I need to get a new eye test.
As soon as we got into town we went straight to see the eye doctor.the assistant sat my wife down in front of the machines then showed us in to the doctors.
My wife explained that she was having a problem seeing at night,the doctor looked at the printout and said âThere seems to be a large change in your right eye but let&rsquo;s check,as he went to put the test frames on my wife said âI Â wear hearing aids now is it ok if I keep them onâ
The doctor put put a black lens in the left side and put Â some lens in the right side, my wife held her hand out to me and said âI can&rsquo;t read any of that.
He kept adding more lens,eventually my wife could manage the see the big E even thought it was just a blur.
Then after testing the left eye,the doctor explained that my wife had a big change and very little sight in her right eye now,but her left eye had not changed as muchÂ 
Her right eye was now -32 - 8 130 and left eye -19 -390 and it was difficult to know what sort of lens to suggest,as there would be a very big difference in the lens thickness,
If we choose normal lens the right lens would be over one inch thick and very heavy.and if we chose Myodisc lens her field of vision would not be very good in her both eyes.
So after a lot of though the doctor suggested a Myodisc lens for the right eye C39 trifocal lens for the left eye.
That would make the glasses lighter and give her the best field of vision from left eyeÂ 
My wife did not understand what he was meaning but agreed with his decision.
I think if you come back in about 2 hours I should have managed to get a pair ready for you.
When we returned the doctor took my wife&rsquo;s glasses off and opened the case with the new glasses a gentle placed them on her face,
I was shocked when I saw them,the lens for the right eye was quite thick but had a small 22mm circle in the middle and the left lens was the same thickness Â but had 2 lines going all the way across, the doctor then said when he had tested my wife with both lens in the test frames her left eye turned into the corner,so he had add a 10 out prism just to the left lens and had filed a executive trifocal to give her more reading space
He explain that it would take a few days to get used to the new lens,and suggested she should see her main doctor as he thought she might have had a small stroke.
My wife looked out of the window and said it seemed very strange but she Â could see better,but could not see to walk easyÂ 
I did not want her to look in the mirror till we got home as I thought she would freak out when she saw them.</p>
<p>She held my hand tight as we walked out,she said âIt feels so strange I can only see straight ahead with my right eye it&rsquo;s like looking through a tunnel,I can&rsquo;t see the ground In front of me.don&rsquo;t let go of me I&rsquo;m afraidâ.
We went and had a coffee she was surprised how good the executive trifocal lens was for reading the menu,</p>
<p>âI have been to scared to tell you Im nearly blind in my right eye,I nearly hit another car yesterdayâ
You silly girl I never be ashamed of you,I think your new glasses are sexy dear. âLet&rsquo;s go for a walkâ.
âThat&rsquo;s much better I feel safer nowâ.
As we got into bed that night my wife picked up her old trifocals and said âI&rsquo;m going Â to keep my new glasses onâ.
âCome closer please I want you to wear my trifocalsâ.
When she put them on me I felt TOTALY blind,I then heard her open a draw and felt her putting the hearing aids in to my ears that Alice had given me.
âNow we are the same, don&rsquo;t turn the light off I want to see you while we make loveâshe said
When we both woke I realised I had fallen asleep with the hearing aids in.
As I went to take the hearing aids out my. Wife. Said âno don&rsquo;t take them out dear I think you look very sexy wearing themâ.
What could I say
I got up and went into the kitchen to make a cup or tea and toast,
I still had my wife&rsquo;s trifocals on,everything in the distance was a blur but if I lifted my head and looked through the bottom section it was a little bit easier.
I handed my wife her tea and toast,she smiled and said âIt&rsquo;s good I bought black unisex frames for my trifocals,they really suit you.I always wished you wore glassesâ
âI now have a husband that wears glasses and hearing aids just like meâ.</p>
<p>Monday morning came, and I got dressed ready for work.
My wife came up to me and straightened my tie,then said âwait a minutes while I put your glasses on And Your hearing aids in for youâ.Â 
She smiled and said âI remember the first time you put my hearing aids in for me hahaâ
I had no answer to that as I knew what she meant.</p>
