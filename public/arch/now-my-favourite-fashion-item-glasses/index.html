          <p>Now, my favourite fashion item, GLASSES</p>
<p>Nancy, Kim, Ashley and I, Kelley have been close friends since we were in the third grade, and are now in our second year of high school.
We are young women now, and Ashley, has the biggest bust, the rest of us are well developed, and have, what we think, are nice figures.
All of us are blessed with a beautiful head of hair, which we wear in the current style.
Nancy is a natural blonde, Kim and Ashley have brownish colour hair, and I am a curly, red head.
We all think we are pretty nice looking, and are interested in boys.
At our little get together, we talk about fashion , make up, hair, and of course boys, which are the best looking, and what ever other topic comes up.</p>
<p>On Monday morning our class mate Megan, came to school wearing glasses.
Megan is no beauty, and her choice of glasses, sure did not make her look any better.
While having lunch, we discussed Megan wearing glasses, and all four of us feel sorry for her that she is now stuck having to wear glasses.</p>
<p>At the regular school dance, last Friday night, we had a good time.
We all were asked to dance, quite often, but what we all noticed, that Megan did not get a chance to sit down, it seemed that there always was another guy asking her to dance, and quite a few of the guys were the pick of the crop.
We all wondered why?</p>
<p>On Saturday, when we all got together, Megan, was the hot topic, how come she was asked for every dance?
Than Ashley mentioned, she had heard that there are guys, who like the look of a glasses wearing girl.
We could not believe it, wearing glasses sure did not improve your good looks, so we started to discuss glasses .
We started to realize that some of the glasses wearing girls at school looked quite nice wearing glasses,
we just never had paid attention to their look, because we felt sorry for them that they had no other choice, if they wanted to see properly.
Then we got on the subject of guys wearing glasses, and came to the conclusion, we had been very narrow minded about the looks of glasses, and when thinking about it realized, there were some very handsome glasses wearing guys around.
Well just the same, none of us wanted to wear glasses.</p>
<p>That night working at my computer at home, because we had talked so much about glasses,
I looked up some sites about vision and glasses.
What an eye opener, I now know a little about myopia, and presbyopia, and the type of lenses that are used, about prescriptions, what a + sign means, and a – sign means, and now also now have some idea, what astigmatism is.
The more I found out about vision, the more I wanted to know, I realized it is a very interesting subject.
Looking at pictures of glasses wearing men and women, I now have to agree, that a lot of people look very nice wearing glasses.
With what I learned to night, sure made me more aware, of anybody wearing glasses.</p>
<p>The next week at school, I looked at at everybody who wore glasses, and realized most of them
them, looked very nice, if they wore the right type of frame.
I also agree, how handsome, and studious a lot of the guys look when they wear glasses.
Now I am not surprised anymore, that some people prefer the glasses wearing look</p>
<p>I went grocery shopping with my mother to night, and when I looked around, at the cashiers and customers, had never before realized that so many people wore glasses.
Since Megan started to wear glasses, I have learned more about glasses and vision, and I don’t know
why, I am so aware and interested, when I never gave glasses a thought before.</p>
<p>We are having our usual Saturday girls get together, but Nancy was not there, Ashley told us, that Nancy had told her she might be late.
Ashley, then told us that Nancy had some doctors appointments in the past week, but that is all she knew.
We talked about what it might be, and all we know was that Nancy suffered from bad headaches, every once and a while.
About ten minutes later we heard Nancy come in, she yelled, girls, get ready for a surprise.
Then Nancy walked into the room, wearing glasses.
I had a good look at her, the glasses Nancy wore, were a black, very delicate looking frame, and her eyes seem to sparkle behind the lenses.
Nancy, you look fantastic wearing glasses, you look beautiful.
The other girls agreed, Nancy smiled and thanked us, and then told us her story.
I had a lot of headaches, and when I went to our doctor, he advised an eye exam, and I have been told if I wear my glasses all the time, they should eliminate my head aches.
At first, when I was told I had to wear glasses, sure did not want them, but now that I have them and had a good look at myself, kind of like my new look.
Now we all had a chance to try the glasses, I was last, Nancy and I have the same shape face, when I put the glasses on and looked at myself, knew then and there, I wanted to wear glasses,
I loved my glasses wearing look, and all the girls agreed I looked fantastic wearing glasses.
The frame felt so good on my face, and I had no problem seeing, that I hated to take the glasses off.
This was the first time in my life, I had a chance to wear glasses, and I loved it.
Now, how am I going to get my own glasses?</p>
<p>Having spend quite a bit of time on vision and glasses lately, I now am able to read eyeglasses prescriptions.
When I asked Nancy, if I could see her prescription, she looked at me, and said I don’t think I have one.
After I explained what a prescription looks like, she said ,that is in my eyeglasses case at home, and gave it to me the next day.
Reading the prescription, I realized, the lenses were + 1.00, but there was quit a bit of astigmatism.
I realize, that if I want to wear glasses, I need my own prescription.
The opportunity, came sooner than I expected.
There is a driving course at the school, and to get your beginners license, after you write your test, you have to pass the vision test.
When my turn came for the vision test, I made sure I I did not pass, and received a notice to have an eye exam.
My parents were very surprised, nobody in our family wears glasses, how come I might need them.
So, I now have an eye exam scheduled, for Wednesday, after school.
I studied all the information I could find about an eye exam, I want to be myopic, I like the look of myopic lenses better, so perhaps, I can manage to get a prescription for myopia.</p>
<p>Since nobody in our family wears glasses, my mother had made an appointment with a Doctor,
recommended by an elderly, neighbour.
The exam, was like I had read about, the Doctor, being older ,was very obliging.
I pretended to have trouble reading the letters, and he concluded, I was myopic, and had a little astigmatism.
He handed me my prescription, and when I read it noticed, OD .50 , OS .75, that was not very strong.
Then his secretary walked in and told him, he was wanted on the phone.
I noticed the doctor, had not put 0 in front of the numbers
He walked out of the examination room, when I looked around saw his pen lying there, I picked it up and quickly put a one ,in front of both the OD , and OS so now I have the prescription
that I wanted, OD -1,50, OS -1.75</p>
<p>With a big smile on my face, I walked into the optical store next door, to find a nice pair of glasses.
The optician, said, you are so lucky, with the colour of your hair, you look fantastic, with either a black frame, or tortoiseshell, a gold frame, or a natural colour.
So we tried them all, and after a long time , I decided on a tortoiseshell, with a bit of black in it.
Then the optician took the measurement for my pupillare distance, so I asked her what my p.d was, and she told me your p.d. is 63 mm.
I have to remember that.</p>
<p>Now the waiting for the lenses to be fitted into the frame,
I could not wait, to find out, how well I could see, did I make a mistake, increasing the prescription.
Well, I want my glasses to look strong, and not like fake glasses.
The optician, came out of the lab with a big smile, here you are Kelley, when she handed me my glasses.
After I put them on, and looked around, could see reasonable well, and I knew that if I wore them all the time, my vision should be near normal in a few days.
When I looked at myself in the mirror, loved my new look, I sure liked my glasses wearing look.</p>
<p>While riding the bus, on my way home, noticed that I got a lot of looks from my fellow passengers,
many of the guys, seemed to take a real good look, did they like my new look?
I had a little trouble seeing everything perfect, but I was very confident, when I walked into the house.
My younger brother looked at me, and he surprised me when he said, Kelley, you look great, I like your new look.
My parents, were surprised when they saw me wearing glasses, and told me I looked very nice, and asked me if I had to wear the glasses all the time.
Yes, from now on, you will see me wearing my glasses, every time you see me.</p>
<p>I felt so good wearing the glasses now, they are so comfortable to wear, I can see properly, I now have my beginners license, and have been asked for a datesso many times, that now I can be very selective.
My friend Nancy, since she started to wear glasses, has the same experience, but Kim and Ashley still don’t like glasses, and don’t even want to talk about them.</p>
<p>I am sure, I have an eye glasses fetish now, when I have time, I am at the computer, learning more about vision and glasses.
I love the look of my eyes behind the lenses, and I am wondering about inducing myopia to get stronger lenses, that show rings, and some depth.
I now realize, I need money, to buy glasses with stronger lenses, so I can induce myopia.
So I am working at a grocery store now, as a part time cashier, so I can save some money,t o buy my new glasses.
I like my job, lots of people to talk to, and a chance to look at all the people who wear glasses, and I love it when some body tells me how nice I look wearing glasses., and we can talk about glasses.</p>
<p>I am now selecting a new glasses frame, my plan is, to order three identical frames, each with an increase of 1 diopter so when I am ready for a stronger lenses, I have the next pair of glasses ready, and hope nobody will notice the stronger prescription.</p>
<p>About a month later, I ordered my glasses, when they arrived, I ran up to my room, to try them.
When I put the first pair, with the -2.50, and -2.75 on, was surprised how well I could see, so I decided, to start wearing the glasses now.
The frame is a lot different, then my first pair of glasses, but I think, looks fantastic, so I when I saw my mother, I asked her how she liked my new glasses.
When she told me, she liked them better than my other ones, I was so happy, that she never noticed the stronger lenses.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, my vision was again almost perfect, I have had many compliments on my new glasses, but nobody, except one person noticed my stronger lenses, the one who noticed, was Carolyn,
she is another high school student, at work.
When we had our break, Carolyn complimented me on my new glasses, and told me, she loves the stronger lenses.
I asked her, how she had noticed the stronger lenses?
She slowly said, I love the looks of glasses, especially when they have stronger lenses, and I could tell the difference in the lenses of your new glasses right away.
I love to wear glasses, but I don’t think I need them, I never had an eye exam.
So I asked her if she would like to try my glasses, yes I would love to, so I handed her my glasses,
and when she put them on and looked around, said, these glasses are fantastic, they are a little fuzzy, but I am surprised that I can see reasonable well when wearing them.
Well, perhaps you should be wearing glasses.
I would love to have to wear glasses, with the same nice looking lenses, like the ones you are wearing now.
Well perhaps, I can help you, I will bring you a pair of glasses you can try.
The next time, I went to work, and we had our break, I gave Carolyn my old pair of glasses to try.
When Carolyn put them on and looked around, she took the glasses off and put them on again, and said, when wearing the glasses I can see everything far away so much better, I can’t believe it.
Carolyn looked great wearing glasses, and when I told her, she said sorry, I have to go to the bathroom, so I can have a look at myself.
When Carolyn came back, she was all smiles, Kelley, I love my new look, can I keep wearing the glasses?
Sure, if you want to, till you get your own.
The next day, Carolyn wore the glasses to school, she was so proud of herself.</p>
<p>Carolyn, and I became best friends, no real surprise, we both love glasses.
When I met her mother, she thanked me for getting Carolyn to realize that she needed to wear glasses
I told her mother, I was glad I could help her.
I talked Carolyn into getting an eye exam, so she would know the proper sphere, and axis, and then she could order her glasses on line.</p>
<p>I was really surprised when after Carolyn’s eye exam, she showed me her prescription, it read OD -1.75 OS - 2.00 , no wonder she could see so well wearing my old glasses.
Carolyn is now ready to order her supply of glasses, she is like I am, trying to become more myopic.</p>
<p>By the time we finished high school, I was wearing -5.00 glasses, Carolyn is now wearing – 6.00 glasses.
We just love our new look, where the lenses show some depth, and a lot of rings, we sure are two happy glasses wearing girls,</p>
<p>Thinking back, I still can’t believe, that after Megan started to wear glasses, it changed me, from a girl who did not want glasses, to a girl who loves wearing glasses, and would not want to be without , my favourite fashion item, GLASSES.</p>
