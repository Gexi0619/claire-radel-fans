        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>Jim and Jeff were cousins , they lived on the same street,and always have been close friends,
they are like brothers.
They loved playing sports and were very active in any other activity.
When in high school ,both Jim and Jeff were very popular with the girls.
Jeff, fell in love with Laura, a pretty blonde haired well build girl , she wore glasses for myopia.They date regularly and enjoyed each others company.
During one of their dates , Jeff mentioned having more head aches lately, when reading and studying.
Laura suggested he should get his eyes examined , he might have a vision problem.
When Jeff had his eye exam , he was prescribed glasses for hyperopia and told he should wear his glasses all the time.
Laura was with him at the optical store , and helped him select a frame they both liked .
When Jeff got his new glasses , Laura told him he looked fantastic, so Jeff did not mind having to wear glasses.
It did not take Jeff long to realize how much easier it was to read , and no head aches.
When Jim asked him about the glasses, Jeff told him he realized now he should have been wearing
glasses a long time ago.</p>
<p>Jim started to date Katie, a very sweet , athletic type girl.
They dated all through high school, and since Laura and Katie got along so well , they often went as a foursome.
Jim and Jeff s friendship was as strong as it had always been.</p>
<p>After their post secondary studies , Jeff and Jim both secured well paying positions , and not long after  they both married their  sweethearts ,  settled down to enjoy married life.</p>
<p>They maintained their close friendship , and when Jeff and Laura had a baby  boy , they asked
Jim and Katie to be his god parents.</p>
<p>A few years later Jeff and Laura s family had grown to two boys , Bryson the oldest , a girl Ashley and the Jimmy.
Jim and Katie were the proud parents of a girl, Kim and a boy named Logan, and of course their god parents were Jeff and Laura,</p>
<p>The children in both families grew fast , Bryson had started school and Ashley and Kim now went to kindergarten
The two families enjoyed spending a lot of time together , they would go on picnics and playgrounds and they all had lots of fun.</p>
<p>About a year later , Jeff came home from work and informed Laura , that he had been asked
to take a business trip to close an important deal in the Middle East., and since he would have some spare time they had suggested he could take his wife.
Jeff and Laura discussed the offer , and contacted Jim and Katie about babysitting their family for a week.
Jim and Katie told them sure , it will be fun to have a large family
Sleeping arrangements would be simple , the girls were about the same age and could sleep in one room , and they had bunk beds for he boys.
Jeff informed his boss that he had made all the arrangements for his family, so he and Laura could
make the trip.
Everything was ready for them to leave the following week.</p>
<p>After Jeff and Laura had left , the children settled in fast.
Katie really enjoyed looking after all of them.
Jeff and Laura were in touch with them everyday.
When their business was completed , they informed them they were ready to leave for home.
On the way to the airport, their car was blown up, and both Jeff and Laura died.</p>
<p>Everybody was very upset , and Jeff s children asked Katie what was going to happen
Don t you worry , you will be looked after, we are your godparents.
After the funeral, all the members of the families , after talking to Jeff and Laura s children , suggested Jim and Laura should adopt them.</p>
<p>It did not take long for Jim and Katie to get used to having a house full of kids, and for the children to feel at home.</p>
<p>About 6 months  later Katie received a notice in the mail to renew he drivers license.
When she went to the office was surprised she had to take a vision test.
and she was even more surprised when she failed the test
When she went for an eye exam she was of course full of questions.
The optometrist explained how vision can decline so slowly, that we hardly notice it., and only realize it when we have our vision tested.
It is more important with children as they do not know what perfect vision is like.
Since many adults do not know the signs of vision problems , regular eye exams are very important.</p>
<p>When Katie got her new glasses was very surprised with the improvement in her vision.
She had not realized her vision was that poor , and know understood why she had failed the viaion test for her drivers license.
When she came home wearing glasses , both Bryson and Ashley said they were so happy she wore glasses now , because now she looked more like their mother.</p>
<p>Jim ,Kim and Logan all told her they liked her new look.
Perhaps wearing glasses was not so bad , she sure liked all the compliments  she had received.</p>
<p>Katie discussed with Jim what the optometrist had told her, about vision deteriorating slowly.
I had noticed that signs were not as clear as before , but never thought I needed to wear glasses.
Off course I never knew much about vision and glasses
The optometrist also mentioned that that children do not realize if they have vision problems.
I know that Laura started to wear glasses at an early age .
Jeff wore glasses.
I think we have to make sure that all the children s vision is normal, and have their eyes examined.
So appointments were made.</p>
<p>Katie took the girls first to get their eyes examined.
Ashley took after her mother and was myopic, and was prescribed glasses.
When she put her new glasses on , was so happy to see that the trees had leaves ,and how much better she could see.
Ashley loved her new glasses , and thanked Katie for getting her eyes examined and the glasses.
Kim did not need glasses and was very disappointed she would like very much having to wear glasses
just like Ashley.</p>
<p>When the boys had their eye exam , Bryson took after his dad and was hyperopic and the only one of the boys to need glasses.
Bryson after a few weeks of wearing his glasses was happy to have them.
Reading was so much easier ,and he could see just fine.
Katie was glad that she had the children s eyes examined , and that both Ashley and Bryson s eyes were now properly looked after.</p>
<p>About a year later, when Jeff s children were now feeling right at home , and on occasion even called Katie and Jim, mom and dad, it was time for another yearly eye exam.
Ashley had an increase in her prescription and was now - 1.50  in both eyes.
Kim was very disappointed again that she did not needed to wear glasses.
Bryson also had an increase in his prescription and was now + 1.25 for the right  and .+ 1,50 for the left eye and some astigmatism.
The big surprise was when Logan was prescribed  glasses for hyperopia.
Kim was wally mad about that. how come her younger brother needed glasses but not her.</p>
<p>Katie was feeling so much better now having to wear glasses.
Besides being able to see so  well , she had learned a little about eyesight , and the importance of eye exams, which had helped her children with their vision.
Sh certainly had not expected that 3 of the 5 would be wearing glasses now.</p>
<p>Ashley was very happy with her new glasses , she loved the frame , and like wearing her  glasses.
Kim asked Ashley if she could have her old glasses.
Ashley said sure , I  know that will make you happy, then you have glasses to.
Kim certainly was happy , and wore Ashley s old glasses every chance she got,, and soon was able to see perfect when wearing them.
A short time later at school. Kim started to notice that the writing on the blackboard looked fuzzy. and she had to bring Ashley s old glasses to school so she could see what was written on the blackboard.
She now realized, that she had to wear Ashley s old glasses to see properly.
Now she was looking forward to her next eye exam, she would be prescribed to wear glasses
like she wanted.</p>
<p>Jim mentioned to Katie that he had  more headaches lately , and was sure that a lot of reading and the computer were the cause .<br>
Katie told him he should have his eyes examined , he might need glasses .
After Jim had his eye exam , and came home wearing glasses , Ashley Bryson and Jimmy told him he looked like their dad now, and looked fantastic wearing glasses.</p>
<p>Because Kim had been wearing Ashley s glasses so much had become myopic and she now started to squint more often to see properly.
Katie who now was more familiar with some vision problems , noticed Kim squinting quite a bit , and asked her if she had vision problems.
Kim told her that things far away looked fuzzy, and had trouble reading what was on the blackboard at school.
We will have to make an appointment for you,  I am surprised you are not due for an exam for another 4 months.
The optometrist was very surprised , Kim s prescription was - 1.25 for both eyes , a big change from not needing glasses at her last exam.
Kim had a wonderful time selecting a frame , and when her glasses were ready was so happy, she had her very own glasses now.
She loved the looks and the feel of them , and her vision was great.</p>
<p>After a great summer of camping and other enjoyable activities , it was time for everybody s annual   eye exam.
The exam went fast , there were some small increases, but the big surprise was when Jimmy was told he was myopic and was prescribed glasses.
He did not mind having to wear glasses  everybody else in the family did, and they did not complain.</p>
<p>That night talking to Jim , Katie wondered what would have happened if she had past her drivers license vision test.
Jim told her he was sure all of them would not be wearing glasses now.
Katie agreed.
She did not mind at all having to wear glasses , and after talking to the optometrist  had learned enough so that everybody in the family was properly looked after
She was so glad she had failed the vison test.</p>
