        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>My mother told me .</p>
<p>My name is Amy, I have an older brother, and younger sister.
Both my parents wear glasses, I understand they are, what is  called nearsighted, and need to wear glasses to see anything far away.
I think my dad looks very handsome wearing glasses  and  I really like the way mom s glasses look on her , she looks so nice.
Almost all of  my aunts and uncles , and a large number of their children wear glasses .
I am so used to see everybody I know wearing glasses , that I never really think about glasses any other way.
That all changed to day.</p>
<p>We have our annual eye exam just before school starts.
I am used to the routine of an eye exam , it is almost like going to the family doctor, everything looks good and healthy, is the regular comment.
It was different to day.
My brother was told he is myopic and was prescribed glasses.
He is not very happy , he is starting  high school and wants to try out for the football team, and  he does not want to wear glasses.
My sister and I were told our eyes are healthy and we don t need  glasses.</p>
<p>When we came home , I asked my mother ,about my brother needing to wear glasses and  if she thought I would need to wear glasses when I get older.
She told me she was not surprised my brother needed to wear glasses, she had noticed he had showed signs he could not see properly, like reading to close to the page and squinting .
She  expects all of us having to wear glasses before going into high school,   myopia runs in the family.
I did not know what to think about that.
I asked her what it was like to have to wear glasses all the time.
Glasses are no real trouble, you are able to see properly ,the frames are  comfortable, and soon you
don t even realize you are wearing glasses .</p>
<p>Now I became very conscious about glasses., I might be wearing glasses  soon.
I had never thought about me having to wear glasses.
What would I look like wearing glasses ?
What would people and the kids at school say when they see me wearing glasses ?
Now I  don t know if I even want  to wear glasses.</p>
<p>When my brother came home a couple of days later wearing his new glasses, I could not believe how handsome he looked .
When I told him , he smiled and told me he could not believe how much better he could see now., and since mom will let him wear contact lenses for sports , he feels much better now about having to wear glasses .</p>
<p>The next day, when  I got together with my friends Jenny and Megan,  I told them all about the eye exam ,  about  my brother having to wear glasses and how handsome he looks.<br>
I also told them  my mother is sure  I will be  be prescribed glasses .
Megan  surprised us , when she  told us that she has an appointment for an eye exam next week, her mother did not like her squinting so much , and sitting so  close to the T V.
I know for sure ,I  need to wear glasses.
My older brother started  wearing  glasses last year, and when he let me try his glasses , I noticed a big improvement in my vision.
What about you Jenny ?
Well I have been getting a lot of headaches lately when reading a lot , and my mother made an appointment for me  with our  family doctor.
I could not believe that both my friends had so much news.
It sure sounded that I would not be the only one who will be wearing glasses, which made me feel a whole  lot better.</p>
<p>When we got together again the following week , Jenny told us her doctor had recommended she have an eye exam, he expected the headaches were caused by a vision problem.
When we asked Megan if she had her eye exam, she pulled out a pair of glasses and put them on.
We both commented how nice she looked wearing glasses .
She told us that she cannot believe the improvement in her vision .
She  likes the looks of her  glasses and does not mind  having  to wear glasses.
When she let me try her glasses,  I noticed that everything looked  more defined, I liked that.
I looked at myself in the mirror and was surprised how nice I  looked wearing the glasses.
When it was time for all of us to go back to school both Megan and Jenny wore their new glasses and did not receive any negative comments.
Besides Megan and Jenny  there are two other students in our class wearing glasses now.
Since I had always liked sitting in front of the class room , I never noticed any  change in my vision.</p>
<p>Time goes fast , and it is time again for our yearly eye exam.
I have grown a lot and will be starting high school this fall.
When I had my exam , the optometrist told me I had a big change in my vision , I now  have to wear glasses .
He told me my prescription is – 1.25 for the right and -1.50 for the left eye.
When I put my new glasses on could not believe the  fantastic improvement in my vision.
I liked the look of my frames and it did not take me long to realize that wearing glasses is not the end of the world.
My brother had a noticeable increase in his prescription , and is now – 2.50 on both eyes.
My younger sister is now  wearing glasses  to ,  just like my mother said we would all be wearing glasses.</p>
<p>After wearing glasses for a few years  and  a noticeable increase in my prescription ,
I have grown into  well developed  young woman.
I am very proud of  my hair , my looks are very important to me , because I do some modelling .<br>
Now  I am so used to looking at myself wearing glasses , that I don t like the way I look without wearing  my glasses,
No contact lenses for me.
Wearing glasses certainly has not effected my popularity with boys, I have lots of dates.
I really like the looks of glasses  ,and now  prefer the looks of guys who wear glasses, they look so much  more mature , studious and handsome .</p>
<p>In the fall I will be going to a business college to study design , display and advertising.
To further  my interest in fashion and modelling.</p>
<p>After my  last eye exam  I  had another  small increase in my  prescription .
Now my right eye is – 3,50 and my left eye -3.75  , and a little bit of astigmatism.
I noticed my lenses  show some power rings , I like that look.</p>
<p>Time flies and I just fished my first year of the 2 year college course.
I have a summer job at our local mall , helping with promotions and advertising.
It is a great job and gives me  a lot of practical experience.
I still have some dates but nothing serious.</p>
<p>The big surprise came when I had my annual eye exam , no increase in my prescription.
I took advantage of the 2 for 1 sale and now can wear a different pair of glasses whenever I feel like it .
Wearing glasses has made  me feel more  confidant , I like that feeling.</p>
<p>I am  in my final year of college , and looking forward to graduating and becoming part of the working world.
While studying in the library to day, I had a feeling I was being watched.
After a while , I realized , a very handsome guy was standing there, really looking at me.
I pretended to go and take  a book back, and walked close to him.
When I came close , he asked me if I could help him.
I smiled and said what can I do for you ?
With a big smile on his face he said , I like to go and have a coffee but prefer  my coffee  with  some  pleasant good looking company.
Can I buy you a coffee?
Yes , you can, I just found what I was looking for, and I am finished here in the library.
Logan introduced himself , I told him my name and we went to the coffee shop.
When we sat down , I had a chance to have a good look at him.
Wow ! He is a handsome guy , and very personable ,  we had a long pleasant conversation.
He asked me for a date, and I accepted.</p>
<p>When Logan came to get me , he suggested we have lunch at his favorite Italian restaurant.
It is a very cozy romantic place and the food is excellent.
He told me that he took the business course to prepare himself to work with  his dad in the family  business.
When we were lingering over our deserts and coffee , I noticed him staring at me.
When I asked him about it , he apologized .
He told me he is fascinated by the lenses in my glasses.
I never   have  never noticed , the mimification at the edges of the lenses before, and like that.
I took my glasses off and showed him what he was looking at.
He  then told me he does not know anything about glasses , I never had an eye exam ,  all I know is , that you look beautiful wearing glasses, and that my parents wear glasses for reading .
I told him , I grew up with everybody around me wearing glasses , we are  a myopic  family.</p>
<p>After our lunch we decided to go and see a movie.
When we got settled in our seats and the movie had started , I noticed Logan being uncomfortable.
When I looked at him he seemed to be squinting..
A little later he mentioned he was getting a headache .
I suggested we go to the food court and have a cold drink and that  I had some pills in my purse to help cure his headache.
While we were having our drink I noticed Logan squinting when he looked at anything far away.
I asked him if he had vision problem.
No , I can see just fine., the movie was not very clear , but thanks to your pills ,my head is feeling better now.
I am now sure Logan has a vision problem and he does not realize it.
When Logan took me home , he asked if we could try again next weekend.
I told him I am looking forward to it.
That night I dreamed of Logan wearing glasses , and how handsome he would look.</p>
<p>When I was getting ready for my next date , I asked my brother if he still had his first pair of glasses.
He told me he did , and after I explained why I needed them ,  he gave me the glasses,
and said  I think you are  right , good luck Amy.
I put the glasses in my purse , I am sure I am doing the right thing.</p>
<p>When Logan came to get me , he was all smiles and in a great mood.
Lets go and see a movie, by the way I brought some head ache pills.
Well , I don t think you are going to need them to day.
We settled  in our seats ,had a couple of kisses and waited for the movie to start.
After the movie had started. I asked Logan if the picture was better to day.?
No , not really , it still looks fuzzy.
Well I think I might have the answer to your problem , do you trust me , and will you give it a try ?
Sure, I trust you and will do anything you suggest,  is it magic ?
No,  wear these glasses  and see if they help  improve your vision.
I handed Logan the glasses and made sure he put the glasses on.
He looked at the picture for a short time and said,  Amy, I cannot believe it , the picture now looks almost  perfect .
Amy , you are not only beautiful, but smart to, thank you.
When the movie was finished and we walked into the mall ,  Logan was still wearing the glasses.
Amy, I can see so well wearing these glasses I almost hate to take them off., what do I do now ?
I think you have to  make arrangements for an eye exam , and get glasses with the proper prescription,
Come with me , we can go to the optical store and arrange for an appointment.
When we walked in , the optician remembered me and I told her that Logan liked to make an appointment for an eye exam.
The optometrist is not busy right now , if it is convenient we can look after him in about 15 minutes.
Logan said great , and filled out the paperwork.
While we were waiting Logan tried some different frames, and he was really surprised how good he looked wearing glasses.
Amy, I am all excited !!
Before he could finish what he was going to say, he was ushered into the examination room.
I asked the optician for the prescription reading on my brothers old glasses.
She checked the prescription , and gave me a print out.</p>
<p>Logan came out of the examination room smiling.
He handed me his prescription .
When I read it and compared it to the print out , showed that Logan s prescription read  ½ diopter stronger on each eye.
Thanks to the one hour service , Logan is now a fantastic looking glasses wearing guy.
Megan , I don t know how to thank you , I never realized how a persons  vision can improve so much
by just wearing glasses.
While we were driving home , Logan kept on mentioning things he could now see and had never noticed before.
I kept looking at Logan to enjoy his new look.</p>
<p>Logan where are we going ?
I am taking you my home ,so you explain to my parents why I am wearing glasses now.
I have not met your parents .
You will now.
After parking in the drive way, Logan walked around the car and opened my door..
His mother must have seen us drive in , because she opened the font door and said Logan what happened to you ?
You are wearing glasses!
Mother , I like you to meet Amy, it is her fault that I wear glasses , she  will explain it all to you.
Hello , Amy, my you are beautiful, please come in.
After meeting Logan s dad and we all were seated ,Logan s mother said Amy ,what is the story.?
Well my mother told me a long time ago the signs people show , when they might have vision problems like myopia.
Last week during the movie Logan,  showed me almost all the signs she had told me about ,and I was sure he had  a vision problem
So to day , when we were watching the movie and Logan was having trouble seeing it clearly, I handed him a pair of my brothers old glasses.
After he wore the glasses ,realized he  could see so much better and should  wear glasses.
That s the story.</p>
<p>Thank you Amy, I feel bad that I never noticed he might have a vision problem.
I must admit he looks very handsome wearing glasses.
Logan s father suggested we join them at The Club for dinner and we could stay for the dance .
I phoned my mother and told her I why I would not be home for supper.
She told me  to bring  Logan home for dinner to morrow night, she wants to meet him.</p>
<p>After a very pleasant night with Logan s parents</p>
<p>When Logan came for dinner , I was so proud of him.
He looked so handsome , I gave him a big kiss and had trouble keeping my hands of him.
My parents are very impressed with him .
Of course my brother smiled when he saw Logan wearing glasses, and said Amy where did you find that handsome glasses wearing guy ?
We had a great night .
After Logan had gone home my mother told me she was very impressed with Logan, and said
I hope you realize that if you marry him , you might  have a myopic family.
Yes I know, but I am sure that we all will love our cute glasses wearing boys and girls.
Don t forget you told me all about all the signs  to look for .
I will never forget that you told me.</p>
