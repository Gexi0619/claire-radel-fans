          <p>The Job, Part 1
This is my first story on V&amp;S, but I do have aÂ  story on Bobby&rsquo;s site &lsquo;The Fancy Dress Party. I wrote that some years ago and finding myself between jobs, I&rsquo;veÂ  taken up the quill again.</p>
<p>On that first day Jane reflected on how strange it was to be looking forward to starting proper job. She should have been dreading it. A receptionist in the local town was not what she&rsquo;d Â expected when she graduated with a first in English. But during her final year graduate hiring had dried up and there were nearly 4m unemployed. She remembered telling herselfÂ  &ldquo;Oh well at least I am at a good Uni and if I work that bit harder I might get a first.&rdquo; That extra motivation worked and she got the First. But it made no difference, there was still no job. Â Among her friends, the best off financially were those who had rejected Â University and started work 3 or 4 years ago. Some of them were already moving up the chain into management, not to mention the property ladder. Â </p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s new job was receptionist at an audiology and opthalmy practice. She really didn&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;d selected her at interview, but maybe having put phonetics on her CV had helped. To make matters worse she&rsquo;d split from her long term boyfriend because living at home and the pressures of Â finding work had taken its toll. What had gone wrong? It was true that they were not altogether compatible as Steve was very gregarious and liked to go out as part of a large group. Jane never felt comfortable in those situations as she could not relax and felt left out.</p>
<p>On the first morning at work, the place seemed very friendly and Â Dave the manager had taken the trouble to introduced Jane to all the staff, or at least those on duty that morning. The practise employed 4 audiologists, two of whom were part time and worked only 3 days a week. Dave explained the booking system and Â showed her how to transfer calls from the phones. No patients were booked for the monday morning as they always kept that period clear for staff Â training. Jane was also introduced to Sally her opposite number in the Opthalmy clinic. Sally was a tall blonde girl who wore striking Â glasses.Â </p>
<p>Gradually over the course of the week, Jane started to learn about the audiology practice. There was Steve the technician who took patient&rsquo;s ear moulds and did the trimming of the plastic prior to fittings. Jackie, one of the Audiologists, took Jane out at lunchtime and they shared stories about college life over Coffee and a sandwich âIâm buyingâ said Jackie, âyou can buy next time when youâve had a first paycheque.â Â On Jane&rsquo;s second morning Â Steve came out to the front office and said. &ldquo;Jane, the booking system shows we are not expecting any patients for the next 30 minutes, could you spare me some time?&rdquo;. Â Apparently Steve wanted to try out a new ear mould solution that set more quickly and was said to get a better impression of the patient&rsquo;s ear. During the process, Steve was interrupted by a phone call and ended up taking impressions of both Jane&rsquo;s ears and Jane got back to her desk just in time for the next patient visit.</p>
<p>A week later, Steve had a delivery from the Lab and was scratching his head to recall a patient simply Â titled âJaneâ The he remembered the trial session and realised he must have sent Jane&rsquo;s earmold impressions Â to the Lab by mistake. ButÂ to make sure Â he decided to try out the moulds in Jane ears. Just as he&rsquo;d inserted the mould in Jane&rsquo;s left ear, Dave came through the prep area, spotted Jane sitting in the prep chair and said. &ldquo;oh Jane&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know you had become a patient? &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Jane blushing. &ldquo;I was helping Steve out, he&rsquo;s checking some new earmold material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve explained that he hadn;t originally intended to send the casts away but having done so, it seemed a good idea to see how well they&rsquo;d turned out. Dave picked up the other mould and pushed Jane&rsquo;s hair back to insert the other mould. &ldquo;Do they feel comfortable?&rdquo; asked Steve. Jane looked at him and he realised she hadn&rsquo;t heard him.Â </p>
<p>Dave suddenly looked thoughtful and said &ldquo;Jane, would you mind waiting in the chair for a few minutes&gt;. When Â Dave returned, he was carrying something in the palm of his hand but was careful not to let Jane see.</p>
<p>Â he said &ldquo;I am just going to make a slight adjustment to these moulds&rdquo; he said. Jane felt him pulling on the mould in her left ear and then moving to the right. Still unseen by Jane, Dave motioned to Steve and they both stood behind Jane&rsquo;s head.Â 
Jane felt their hands behind her ears. Â She turned round to see Dave and Steve standing back smiling and holding a mirror. Steve grabbed Jane&rsquo;s hand and put it to her ear. As she looked at him, he moved the other hand to the other ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; he said. I have attached proper behind the ear aids to your earmolds. You are wearing hearing aids.&rdquo;
Jane jumped up and rushed to the mirror and pulled back her hair. &ldquo;Oh they are tiny&rdquo; she said, then &ldquo;oh - how odd my voice sounds&rdquo;. She pulled a small plastic comb from her dress and within a brief flurry of Â hands, coiled her hair up. Steve picked up a mirror and showed Jane the rear view of her exposed ears.</p>
<p>Steve explained that these were a new line in BTE aids intended for people with mild to moderate loss. He had adjusted the setting to the minimum so the amplification matched the blocking of sound by the ear moulds.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Jane said &ldquo;may I wear them for a few minutes and walk around the building to get used to the sound. &ldquo;Well actually&rdquo; said Dave, I was sort of hoping that you would wear them at your desk in reception. The idea suddenly came to me when I saw you sitting there. One of the girls in the ophthalmology practice had almost perfect vision but often wears strong prescription glasses in the shop as she feels it gives her more empathy with the patients.Â 
I know its a bit of a cheek but I wondered if you would mind doing the same for us? You would have to try them a bit at a time otherwise your ears may get sore, and if you simply don&rsquo;t like it, there&rsquo;s no problem.
Jane thought for a moment and then said. &ldquo;OK, as long as I can take them out if I have to leave the building or go out in my lunch hour.â</p>
<p>Later that day when Jane was out in reception, Steve pointed out to Dave that they should actually give Jane a proper hearing test. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose we should , I&rsquo;ll book a slot for one of the audiologists and we can tell Jane that its part of her training.Â </p>
<p>Dave had explained to Jackie,the audiologist that this was a training session for Jane but that the tests should be real and the results should not be discussed with her, as was the protocol with all &rsquo;new&rsquo; patients.</p>
<p>That afternoon Jane was called into the examination room and after a few standard questions, the audiologist handed Jane some headphones and went through the test cycle, First the left ear then the right. At each change of tone and Janeâs response, the audiologist replied âgoodâ. Â When it came to the right ear Jane noticed that the Audiologist repeated some of the stages, going down a level and back up. At the end of the test Jane asked about her right ear but Jackie said the differences were minor, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The Â next day when she got in was very careful to put Â the aids in before anyone else arrived. Taking them carefully from the box she pressed the moulds into her ears as Steve had shown her and then hooked the aid over behind her ear and gently pushed the on switch. The left aid burst into life just as Sally appeared in the doorway. &ldquo;Hi Jane&rdquo; said Sally causing Jane to look over. The clarity of Sally&rsquo;s voice startled her, it was if she was standing by her shoulder.
&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s a very dinky BTE aid&rdquo; said Sally. Jane instinctively tried to cover her ear embarrassed that Sally might actually think she was deaf. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not..&rdquo; Jane started to say, Â but Sally interrupted her. &ldquo;Put the other one in and let me see you with your hair up&rdquo;. Jane compiled and turned her head so Sally could see both ears. Sally whipped out her phone and took some pictures. âLet me guessâ said Sally, theyâve got you wearing hearing aids to empathise with the clients.</p>
<p>Jane, wondering what was different about Sally, realised she wasn&rsquo;t wearing her glasses and remarked how different she looked.
&ldquo;Oh, they are in my bag, I got up late and haven&rsquo;t put my contacts in yet&rdquo;. Jane looked more puzzled. Sally smiled and said, &ldquo;oh, they didn&rsquo;t tell you, I really have perfect eyesight but Â I wear contacts with the glasses so I look like I really do belong in an opticians. She pulled the glasses out of her bag, &ldquo;here, try these on and let me get some more pictures&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With the glasses on Jane could only make out vague shapes in the room and Sally had to steer her around the desk to get her to pose for a few shots. Putting the phone in her hand and adjusting the direction, &ldquo;and finally a selfie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally took the glasses and they scrolled through the pictures, but it took a few moments for Janes vision to return to normal. &ldquo;I think they really suit you&rdquo;. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I look like a dork?&rdquo; replied Jane.
&ldquo;No, not at all, they give you a much brighter outlook. I&rsquo;ll let you into a secret, I am only really supposed to wear these in the office but lately I&rsquo;ve been going out and about in them. I get many more compliments when I do. &quot;
&ldquo;You mean from men?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Both men and women actually, I don&rsquo;t mind which, a compliment is a compliment.&rdquo; If we got you some too, we could go out on the town as two GWGs and you will find out for yourself. &quot;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a GWG?&rdquo;
&ldquo;A girl with glasses, it&rsquo;s really trendy and fashionable now&rdquo;.
&ldquo;I suppose I could,&rdquo; said Jane, with the thought that it any new new male company would be quite nice. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t afford to spend too much, I&rsquo;m still paying off my Student loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No silly, they would be free as you will be deputising for me sometimes&rdquo;. Â We can just get you an eye test, that should do it.</p>
<p>Mid morning Â Sally rang down to say that Jane should come up to the Ophthalmic practice at 12.00 as it was all arranged.</p>
<p>Sally was taken into the examination room and sat in front of the phoropter. The ophthalmist explained he was going to test Sally&rsquo;s normal vision and then insert some contacts and retest her for glasses.
&ldquo;Well Jane &quot; he said after the first series of tests, &ldquo;have you ever been prescribed glasses?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&rdquo; Jane said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been told I had perfect vision&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not so, I&rsquo;m afraid. Your left eye is quite long sighted and I could prescribe glasses even before we start with the contact test. They would help I&rsquo;m sure, but let&rsquo;s continue as we intended&rdquo;. He went to a cupboard and brought out two plastic vials. &ldquo;Sally, would you help Jane insert the contacts while I update her records.&rdquo;
When the exam was over Jane and Sally went to choose frames. Jane wanted to pick two lightweight frames but Sally insisted on one pair being quite heavy. Sally said, &ldquo;trust me, these are going to look great with your new lenses.&rdquo;
&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; said Jane anxiously. &ldquo;Well we have cheated a bit, I already have some glasses here for you that work with the contacts, but I want you to choose another pair.&rdquo;
30 minutes later the two girls were back in the examination room and Sally watched as Jane struggled to get the contacts back in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lab will send the two new Â frames through in a couple of days but for now let&rsquo;s see you in these.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Two new frames?&rdquo; Said Jane, &quot; I thought we just needed one pair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo; said Sally, &ldquo;the ophthalmist said I should get you a second pair in your real prescription, now we know it. He thinks you&rsquo;ll find glasses a help. I told him you were often complaining of headaches.&rdquo;
Jane didn&rsquo;t reply but admitted to herself it was true.she could no longer see the room in any definition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok, sit up straight and look away from the mirror&rdquo; said Sally, &ldquo;now the moment of truth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jane sat nervously listening. The arms of the frame creaked slight as Sally opened them. Jane felt the frame sit against her temples. Sally said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning how to do fittings so you are my guinea pig&rdquo; Sally moved the frames slightly and pushed them back. Jane in fact had her eyes closed.
&ldquo;Ta-da&rdquo; said Sally, turning the chair so Jane faced the mirror.
Sally opened her eyes, realised she could see again, but still didn&rsquo;t look at herself. Turning her head slightly, a face appeared in the mirror. It was of a girl older than herself, but with thick bulbous lenses dominating the image.
Jane sank inwardly, she was ugly.
&ldquo;Oh Sally, they are very different to yours, my eyes look huge&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Yes, sorry about that, but we thought it best for if your makeup you will look good.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I hardly wear makeup&rdquo; said Jane.
&ldquo;All part of the plan, I&rsquo;m taking you to the Boots makeup counter tomorrow Â afternoon, it&rsquo;s all arranged and paid for.&rdquo;
Jane felt she should be cross but didn&rsquo;t have the energy to resist. Sally did wear quite a lot of makeup, thought Jane.
&ldquo;No one said I&rsquo;d be going out and about like this, I thought I just had to wear them in the building?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I thought that at first but it&rsquo;s impractical to keep taking the contacts out&rdquo;.
It was then time Â to go back to work as the afternoon appointments were due.
Back at her desk, Jane felt really strange, sort of disembodied, and distanced from the world. When one of the technicians came by and complimented her, she smiled weakly and muttered &ldquo;thanks, but I don&rsquo;t really think they are me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get used to them&rdquo; he said.
The next day Sally called down to Jane and said &ldquo;get your coat,&rdquo; .
Outside, Â Sally said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your arm if you wish, and we can avoid stairs, I know it took me some days to get used to judging distances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s sudden appearance had given Jane no time to worry about being seen out wearing the strong glasses. She was conscious that her the contacts made her dependent on these frames on her face.</p>
<p>An hour later and two makeup sessions, Jane carried a bulging makeup bag. Walking Â back she felt passers by were staring at her.</p>
<p>When Jane looked in the mirror in the clinic&rsquo;s restroom it was difficult to comprehend how they had changed her. There was nothing left of her former ânaturalâ look. The combination of the glasses and the makeup she was now applying daily gave her a sense of dislocation, as if it was a different person staring back at her.</p>
<p>Initially Jane Â had assumed she might only wear the glasses when she was covering the opthalmic desk,but As the days progressed she found that removing the contacts was impracticable.</p>
<p>The practice closed at lunchtime and Jane and Sally often spent lunchtimes together. Jane always removed the hearing aids, contacts and glasses before they went out. One day, when Sally found Jane was ready to go, she was still wearing the glasses.
Sally said nothing, but waited to see if it would continue.</p>
<p>The next day, Jane was still wearing the glasses but had her hair up and Sally noticed the hearing aids. Again she said nothing, but managed to hide a little smile. Â As they hit the street, Jane put her hands to her ears and said âoh the noiseâ, and then a moment later. âOMG, Iâm still wearing the hearing aids. Jane put her hands up to her ears attempting to pull them out but Sally said âdonât, you might lose them, just pull your hair down if you donât want people to seeâ. Â </p>
<p>Back in the office Dave and Jackie Â had been looking at Janeâs Audiology report.
Jackie Â went through the results. âThereâs no doubt, sheâs got loss in both ears. If you have the current aids giving her 3db gain across the range sheâs already benefiting without realising it. The moulds only lose her 1 to 2 db. The question is, do we tell her? â Â Dave said, âitâs a difficult oneâ If sheâd come in as a real patient I would have no hesitation in prescribing hearing aids. It wouldnât be a clinical discussion, sheâd be complaining about not being able to hear people or the television. Dave laughed, âwell in her interview she said she rarely watched TV, Â this explains itâ.</p>
<p>Jackie looked at the audiogramme again. I would give her a lift of 35db mid range in her better ear and more in the right ear, maybe 50db.</p>
<p>Dave said, âsheâs only been with us for a few weeks, it would freak her out, sheâd just go into denial. Jackie agreed, adding that in this situation, even in normal patients this would be a gradual process.</p>
<p>âHow about we switch the current aids for those new Siemens ones where adjustments can be made wirelessly without the patient being aware?â Â 
Jackie said âBut show will never be able Â afford them on the salary we pay her.â Dave smiled and said, âjust leave that to me, the Siemens rep owes me and I have no doubt i can win another trial set out of him.â</p>
<p>As it transpired, the next day Dave spotted Jane had left the aids on her desk when she went out for lunch, so he grabbed them and made some adjustments, not to the full amount but adding 6db to each ear.</p>
<p>That day had been quite unusual as Jane no longer bothered to remove the aids when she went out. The previous evening Jane had gone home wearing both the glasses and the hearing aids and only noticed how clear her motherâs voice was when she called out to her at the front door. Jane just said âHiâ and ran straight to her room, straight to the mirror. As she pulled out the hearing aids one of them started to whistle. âOh, thatâs never happened beforeâ she thought and promptly moved Â the battery switches to off.</p>
<p>Looking back in the mirror, there was still that stranger staring back at her. Her subtle but still Â heavy makeup was even more striking, even harsh without the glasses.</p>
<p>It suddenly come to her that it was now two weeks since Sallyâs makeover. Her parents had commented adversely on her new look saying it made her look âtartyâ. Normally, her first thought when she got home would have been to remove the makeup. No, this wasnât going to happen. ~She really needed to become the person in the mirror. The old Jane was gone but the new Jane was incomplete without the glasses. Jane fished in her bag for the Â case. Not the ones she wore at work, but the pair in her own prescription. Her parents could not complain about the glasses as she could say the optician had said she should wear them full time.</p>
