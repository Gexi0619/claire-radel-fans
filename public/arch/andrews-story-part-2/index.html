          <p>Val kindly posted part one for me.
I hope this posts ok
I read that somebody wished more people would write stories, so here is part 2 
Please excuse my grammar </p>
<p>Andrews story part 2 </p>
<p>I did not want to take advantage of Mary  so we just hugged each other then I gentle took her glasses off and put them on the table then slowly took the hearing aids out and laid them beside her glasses then we fell asleep in each other&rsquo;s arms.
I woke first and went into the kitchen and made us coffee and toast and took them back to the bedroom,Mary had not heard me get up so was surprised when I gave her a kiss,She  gave me a smile but without her glasses on I could see why the doctor had prescribed prisms for her glasses,
Her eyes looked so small and very crossed ,it was obvious  that she was nearly blind without her glasses,can I have my reading glasses please she said I can&rsquo;t see anything without them, and I think I like wearing them in the house best.
If my hearing aids are there will you put them in for me,I think I need to get used to wearing them all the time now
When I  started to put The hearing aids in I could see that she was getting sexually aroused, be gentle with me please she said I don&rsquo;t know what to do.I slowly undid the buttons on her top. I was surprised she was wearing a rather full bra with 3 hooks at the back.when I undid the.</p>
<p>Censored </p>
<p>Later I tried to explain to her that life had been very boring and so many girls just looked the same and that I found it exciting and that I loved her large eyes and her bananas behind her ears.
She took off her reading glasses to wipe away the tears both eyes were now TOTALLY in the corners after wearing the 8 out prisms.She was shaking all over,,Mary said could her sister could come for a meal with us tonight as she had not seen her for some time and was a bit worried about her. </p>
<p>The doorbell rung and Mary Asked me to let her sister in,I opened the door Julie was looking down and had a hat on with a large brim I invited her in and took her into the lounge and offered her a drink,I politely asked her how she was and said I like your hat.
She said that she had lost her job at the hotel after she fell out with her boss
What happened I asked.? Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m wearing horrible glasses now.when we were together you used to buy me nice expensive glasses.
I thought you told me you had had surgery so you not need to wear glasses anymore.
Yes  but after 2 weeks  I had a argument with my boss and he punched me twice because I would not have sex with him I started to have problems seeing and was making mistakes at work so company fired me.
I was getting terrible pains in me eyes and had to go to hospital this week for tests and they told me that after being punched in my face the laser treatment had gone wrong. So I had to have emergency surgery to save my retinals My right eye is now even more Myopia than before and my astigmatism has been made much worse also my left eye is now Hypermetropia so I am now short sighted in my right eye and long sighted in my left eye.I got these horrible glasses this morning they were free it&rsquo;s what poor people like me have to wear she pulled a piece of crumpled paper out.It was her prescription it read R- 10.75 -4.50 180 prism 6 in   L +10  prism 10 in .all the while she had been looking down while we chatted.
She then looked up at me and said this is what I look like now, you used to buy me lovely glasses.I did not know what to say she was wearing small round pink NHS glasses the right lens was flat at the front and about one inch thick with prism rings and her eye looked  the size of a pea the left lens had a Hugh bulge in the middle and aslo with many prism rings and this eye looked just as  big as Mary&rsquo;s  and they had wire cable Hooks going around her ears to hold the glasses on.
This is the type girls used to wear at school when they got there first pair.I did not know what to say.Julie grappled hold of me and started cry and saying she was so sorry for hurting me.
I heard Mary  coming so I told Julie to sit down.when she came in Julie was Looking the other way and had taken her glasses off as she turned around Mary  said why have you been crying  what is wrong with your eyes they look strange.I told Mary that had happened and Julie had to wear glasses again.
So what&rsquo;s the problem you used to wear them and we all thought you look nice.for goodness sake put them on and stop making a fuss they can&rsquo;t look any worse than my new bifocals.Julie looked down and put her glasses on,and looked up.
Mary&rsquo;s  mouth dropped open My god what has happened why have you got one tiny eye and one Hugh eye are you trying to get Andrew back.I gave Mary the crumpled paper to read she lowered her eyes to look though the bottom of her bifocals.
She could now understand why Julie&rsquo;s glasses looked so strange.she went over to her sister and started to hug her, the lens in their glasses were so thick they were rubbing againest each others.
Mary asked me to take thier glasses off as they were both crying It was easy to take her glasses off as I had done it many times since we had been together but I was nervous taking Julie&rsquo;s off. It was difficult to take them off they were so heavy as the lens were glass and the hooks were fastened tight behind her ears.</p>
<p>Mary said darling please clean our glasses for us and help Julie put hers on I think with those temple hooks she needs help.I happily agreed first putting Mary&rsquo;s on and adjusting her hearing aids.
Julie said what&rsquo;s that strange noise I can hear?, O! its my hearing aids they whistle sometimes if you touch them,you know I&rsquo;ve had a hearing problem for years but been trying to hide it,Andrew suggested I try hearing aids, I know they are rather large but they were free and it&rsquo;s so nice to hear with them.
Andrew is so sweet about it he always puts them in for me,I know he not mind me wearing them he always makes them whistle he says its him giving me a wolf whistle. Ha 
I picked Julie&rsquo;s glasses up they were so heavy I gentle put them on her nose and hooked the cable temple behind her ears.
Mary said I must do some paper work for the next 2 hours will you get my reading glasses for me Andrew, 
Mary put her thick reading glasses on and Julie said ooo you have to wear reading glasses as well.are they NHS,.they are much nicer than mine,they are nice pink plastic,mine are black metal.
I asked Julie how long she had reading glasses? I can&rsquo;t to see to read with my right eye so they gave me these today to wear,she reached into her bag and opened a glasses case a showed us her reading glasses,they were small round metal ones like her pink one but in black with the right lens blacked out.</p>
<p>Mary asked her sister to help her with the printing she had to do and 
I said I&rsquo;m going out into the garden.it was all to much to take it at once.</p>
<p>When I returned I could not believe what I was seeing.
Both girls were in the kitchen and were still wearing their reading glasses I knew Mary liked wearing her reading glasses best when she was at home but I was surprised to see Julie wearing hers,Mary explained that the light was hurting Julie&rsquo;s right eye when she put her pink glasses back on so she decided to wear her reading glasses  with the right lens blacked out as it helped with the pain also the doctors had told her this morning if the pain continued they would have to remove the right eye.so they thought it a good idea to get used to being blind in that eye.
Mary suddenly said! Julie wants to try one of my hearing aids ,Is it ok,I thought the left one its not as powerful and I can manage with just the one,
Can you turn it off dear before you take it out.Oo I think you better turn my other up a little dear.
Do you want Andrew to fit it in for you Julie.
Yes please 
My hands were shaking as I put the hearing aid into her ear,I never expected to see Julie wearing a hearing aid.she used to make fun about Mary being deaf like an old lady.
I noticed Mary had turned it up to number 4,so before turning it on I set it at number one,as soon as I turned it on Julie said wow I can hear the TV in the other room now.i slowly turned the volume up when I reach number 3 Julie said that&rsquo;s so clear now Andrew.
Can I go into the bathroom to see what it looks like.
When she returned she had put her hair up,can I keep it in please Mary,I can hear so much better with it and  I think if people see this they won&rsquo;t be looking at my ugly gasses as much 
We sat down to eat Mary had her right hearing aid In And Julie had to sit so she could see out of her good eye and had Mary&rsquo;s  other hearing aid in her left ear</p>
<p>I woke early and left a note to say I was going to work and would be back mid afternoon, while I was having my coffee break I got a text from Mary to say she was taking Julie to get her hearing tested,
Later I got another text from Her to say bring some wine home they had some news to tell me.
When I got home I called out,I&rsquo;m back.
A voice called out we are in the kitchen,when I walked into the kitchen I did not know what to say was this a joke.Mary had her hair trimmed and dyed purple then Julie came in and said hi what do you think, I thought I would get my long blonde hair cut and have it short and dyed in the same colour as Marys.
She then turned side way,do you like my hearing aids,I had a test today I have a 24% hearing loss in both ears I could have had smaller hearing aids but Mary suggested I have large ones like her,I noticed she was wearing her reading glasses but gone had the black lens and I its place was a dark purple lens.</p>
<p>We have been living together now for over 9 months now.and for the last 2 months Mary had been wearing her reading glasses all the time and had bought a small magnifying glass for reading her phone.she said I&rsquo;m not going to work I have a bad headache I suggested we go and get her eyes tested.
The eye doctor looked at Mary&rsquo;s record and put the test frame on her and put lens in for her right eye to match her prescription.and a black lens in the left side.
Can you read that line for me please,Mary said no sorry it&rsquo;s all a bluer.he then added more and more lens then which is best one or two then again and again then which is best red or green then the same with the other eye.then he gave her a card to read and more lens were added.
Well Mary how long have you been struggling to see.About 3 months I think but the last 2 have been very difficult.
There is a big change in your prescriptions also you have the start of cataracts I&rsquo;m afraid.
You will have to have 2 seperate pairs of glasses,your distance prescription is now R +18   3.25  160 Prism out 12.   L +19  2.25  120  Prism out 12.
To make them lighter to wear I suggest you start wearing Myodisc lens.What are they Mary asks,well instead of the whole lens having your full prescription in there is a small circle in the middle with your full prescription in,ok if you think so 
doctor.
Now reading is going to be difficult I have given you an extra Add of Plus 6 and increased the prisms to 16 .,the best option will be biopic telescope lens,I will show you a picture.
O they are ugly do I really need them Andrew,well if the doctor suggests it then I think you had better try them.Ok Mary said if you don&rsquo;t mind Andrew we will let you know when they are in will take about 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I get my hearing checked while we are here,I&rsquo;m having a little difficulty hearing on my right side,yes I had noticed that dear,when Mary came out of the soundproof room the audiologist,said Mary is now profoundly deaf in her right ear and  has lost a little more hearing in her left ear.I think the only way to help her to hear on the right side is if we fit a body worn hearing aid on that side.Mary was looking very upset and stressed.I suggested we go outside and have a coffee while they got the new hearing aids sorted,you go and sit down outside dear while I order coffee.
The time has rushed by I think we had better get back and get you fitted with your new hearing aids dear.
The lady had Mary&rsquo;s hearing aids ready first she fitted the more powerful BTE aid in Mary&rsquo;s left ear,then she picked up the body worn hearing aid fitted the large pink button earpiece in the right ear and said to Mary you could hide the box in your bra.when the lady turned both hearing aids on She was asked if she could hear better now,I&rsquo;m not sure,she said but can we go now please Andrew I&rsquo;m getting stressed again I could see was was starting to get upset.
I don&rsquo;t like this horrible large button thing in my right ear only old people wear them,
Darling if you can hear better that&rsquo;s all that matters I know you have  been stressed trying to hear lately.</p>
<p>When we got home I put the TV on,Mary said O Andrew have I had the sound so loud before can you turn it down,that&rsquo;s better,I must admit this body hearing aid is a big help,and if you don&rsquo;t mind me wearing it I expect I get used to the big pink button in my ear.
About 10 days later the opticians receptionist rang to say could we come in there was a slight problem with the glasses we had ordered.
When we got there the doctor explained that the factory had got the 2 orders mixed up.but as he knew Mary was having a problem seeing he thought it better she has these now as it was the factory holiday starting tomorrow and they would be closed for 3 weeks so it would be a least 5 weeks before the correct glasses would arrive. 
They had made Mary&rsquo;s distance glasses in normal C39 plastic with bioptic binoculars fitted.and Her very strong reading glasses were Myodisc
Lens.
First he got her reading glasses out they only had a small 22mm circle In the middle he gave Mary a card to read she said wow I can read all the small print,she turned to look at me they looked very strange as the rest of the lens looked fogged and only the 2 little circle In the middle that were clear,I could only see the centre of her eyes the rest of her eyes were hidden by the fogged Looking part of the lens.
What do you think Andrew I can read so easy but everthing else is a blur.
They look fine dear the main thing is you can read again.
The next pair were a problem,to get everything in they had had to use a bigger black men&rsquo;s NHS frame,I had never seen such thick lens before,the middles were over 1 ½ ins thick then at the bottom there were 2 black bioptic telescopes
Mary had taken her reading glasses off so she could not see what they looked like,which I think was just as well, even I thought they looked dreadful.
He gentle put them on her OOO  she said I can see so good everything in the distance is so clear and sharpe,he gave Mary a card to read u will have to find the right way to look though the bioptic lens.Its wonderful doctor the print is so big and so black on white,I love these glasses Andrew,it&rsquo;s over 10 years I think that I have seen so good, can I keep these doctor,do they look ok Andrew.
As long as you can see well dear then I&rsquo;m happy,what else could I say. 
Can I look outside please doctor.yes but be careful they VERY much stronger than before.Its great Andrew I can see so much better now thank you Andrew for understanding I know I must look ugly with these glasses but it&rsquo;s so nice to see again.
Will you wait here for me Andrew I want to see the lady upstairs my left BTE hearing aid is not working so well.
30 minutes later Mary came down,all sorted she said,look I have got  2 body hearing aids now I can hear so much better with them.
I thought you not like them dear , that was when I first got it but now I hear so good that it&rsquo;s ok I I know you find them sexy haha 
Let&rsquo;s go and get a coffee I&rsquo;m so excited I want to walk to the cafe, 
I think I will put my reading glasses on so I can see the menu Andrew it&rsquo;s not easy getting used the bioptic lens that&rsquo;s better she said but u need to move a bit closer you are very blurred.
Can I look at my distance glasses please Andrew.ooo they are veryyy thick Andrew I never realised are you sure u don&rsquo;t mind being seen with me wearing them,
Of course not dear if you like wearing them then I happy.shall we walk though the park on the way home yes dear I think that a good idea Andrew</p>
<p>Mary loved her new glasses and her body worn hearing aids,it has been over a year since she had them but work was getting more difficult for her now. Seeing out of her right eye was a big problem,she thinks her carteract is getting ripe so we are going to see the eye doctor today.life has been great and Mary has been so relaxed,but the last few weeks she has started to get stressed again 
Hello Mary the eye doctor says.lets have a look to see what&rsquo;s going on.can you try to read any letter now.i know it&rsquo;s a E but I can&rsquo;t see it.ok let&rsquo;s try a few more lens.how is that now,it&rsquo;s better but still blurred.ok let&rsquo;s look at the other eye now.
Do you want to just walk around the showroom and tell me how it is.
Not very good she said.
Ok I think it&rsquo;s time we booked you in for a cataract operation on your right eye,I will put you on the waiting list.but I think it will be one or two year before you will get it done,
In the meantime we will update your glasses for you
I think you are so used to this type of lens so it best we stay with it.you will of course have very little useful sight  in your right eye but you will be able to   shapes and colours.
This is your new prescription
 R+28.50. 4.24 180 Prisim out 18   Add bioptic lens  +10
 L +21.75. 3.25.120 Prisim out 14.  Add bioptic lens + 6
We will put some soft padding on the nose pads for you and I think it&rsquo;s best if we attach a strap to go around the back of your head to hold them on better.
I&rsquo;m sure you realize they will be a lot thicker and heaver.
Yes I thank you doctor can I have the same size Frames  but in pink and a pink strap</p>
