        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>This is a story that will give a lot of readers some insight of how life was in the early 20 th century.
I made up the story about a few facts that I know, and what I was told, the rest is all fantasy.
I was born in 1927, and when growing up realized, that there was a certain amount of class distinction,
After the second world war everything changed, enjoy the liberated life we have to day</p>
<p>Is a girl wearing glasses, not desirable?</p>
<p>Margaret Anderson is my name, I was born in 1896.
I have an older brother Harry, who is at a boarding school.
My dad owns a furniture factory, and has a large number of employees.
I understand we are part of the elite in our town, and I don t really know what that means.
We have always the same seats in the front of the church.
I am told that the common people sit in the back.
I don t know what makes them common people, they look like nice people to me.
My mother always makes sure I am dressed to perfection, and am told to behave accordingly.
We have 3 servants, Jacob, who looks after the garden, and the horses.
His wife Mabel, is our cook, and with her daughter Barbara, who is about my age keeps the house clean.
To keep busy, I do a lot of needlework, and some painting, and love reading.
I don t attend the town school, I am home schooled with my friend Linda, who lives nearby.
Next fall when I will be 16, I am going to a boarding school, to be taught how to be a lady and everything that goes with it.</p>
<p>Over diner to night my mother told us that my brother has vision problems, and now has to wear glasses.
I asked her how he knew, he had a problem.
Well he had trouble reading what was written on the blackboard, and the principal  made sure he had an eye exam
I think a man wearing glasses looks more knowledgeable, important, and respected.
You will see him next week, when he comes home.</p>
<p>When Harry came home wearing glasses, I had to agree with my mother, he looked more mature and knowledgeable.
I complimented him on his new look, and asked him, what it was like to wear glasses?
Margaret, I can see everything so well, it is unbelievable, and the glasses are no problem to wear.</p>
<p>A few days later, when I was reading a book, my brother told me to hold the book farther away fro my eyes.
I told him, if I do that then I cannot see the letters.
Margaret, I think you might need to wear glasses.
Here, try mine.
When I put the glasses on, I could read holding the book farther away, and when I looked out of the window could see things I had never seen before.
I gave Harry his glasses back, yes, they sure make everything look nice and clear.
When my mother walked into the room, Harry told her I should be wearing glasses.
She can t wear glasses, that will spoil her beauty.
Men, don t like women wearing glasses, she will have fewer eligible men calling on her.</p>
<p>Before I went to boarding school, I had an eye exam.
When the doctor put oversize glasses on my face and started to change lenses, I was fascinated when each time he changed the lens, the letters became easier to read.
I was prescribed glasses.
About two weeks later my glasses were ready, I was happy with the improvement in my vision,
and think I look all right, in my gold round framed glasses.</p>
<p>Jacob, drove me in our carriage to the station, and assisted me to get my bags on the train.
I enjoyed the train ride, looking at the scenery, and being able to see everything so well, wearing my new glasses.</p>
<p>Arriving at the school, I was greeted by the head mistress, who asked a very pretty girl to escort me to my room and show me around.
I immediately liked the girl, there was something about her that appealed to me.
After introducing myself to her, she told me her name was Ann, she showed me my room, and told me
her room was next to mine.
After unpacking and getting settled, she showed me around.
We ended up at the dining room, where we had a very enjoyable meal and I met some of the other girls.</p>
<p>That night in my room Ann and I chatted away, to get know each other a little better.
After I told her all about my home and upbringing, Ann said wow, I can t believe it.
Then Ann told me her story.
My father works in a factory, my mother died when I was 10years old.
I had to keep the house clean and cook for my dad, while still going to school.
When I started to develop and my hormones took over, I became a little wild.
My uncle, who is also my godfather, did not like my lifestyle, and arranged for me to come to this school.
I hope you still like me, being a commoner.
Ann, I am so sorry for you, yes I still like you, and I want to be your friend.
Having Ann as a friend, was one of the best things that happened to me.
Now I know that being a woman is more than growing breasts and having a monthly.
How men are different, what is expected in a marriage bed, and a lot of other things I had never been told before.
Life with Ann around, sure was more interesting.</p>
<p>I like good food, and had an opportunity to meet the woman who prepared all our meals.
I started to make regular visits to the kitchen and watch her prepare food, and ask a lot of questions. When I had some free time, I would go to the kitchen to help her.
Enjoying the beautiful gardens, and visiting the kitchen garden regularly, soon knew most of the people working there, and appreciated all their answers to my questions.</p>
<p>To night Ann surprised me when she asked me questions about wearing glasses.
When I let her try my glasses, told me, she thinks she needs to wear glasses.
Since I had noticed I could not see as well as before, talked to the head mistress, who arranged for our
eye exam.
About a week later we went to the eye doctor.
Ann was prescribed glasses, like she expected.
My prescription went up to -3.00, I am not surprised, because my vision is not very good when I take my glasses off.
About a week later both of us were wearing new glasses.</p>
<p>The head mistress told me that my mother wanted me to come home, because a very eligible young man wanted to call on me.
When I came home my mother told me, to morrow afternoon, Mr Thompson is coming over to see you.
Your father and I approve of him, we think he has all the qualifications to make a good husband,
We want you to look your best, and make sure you don t wear your glasses.</p>
<p>The following afternoon I sat prim and proper on the sofa in our living room.
When Mr, Thompson was introduced to me, he kind of shook my hand and gave me a bouquet of flowers.
I tried real hard to see what he looked like, all I could see was a tall slim build man.
After he sat down, told me, he had seen my picture, and had wanted to meet that beautiful girl.
He spend a lot of time telling us how good and important he was, I was not impressed.
Then he asked me, if I might approve of him.
Well Mr Thompson, I better have a good look at you to see what you look like.
I pulled my gasses out of my pocket and put them on.
You wear glasses?
Oh my, I did not know, the glasses spoil your beauty, you cannot wear them.
O yes I can, that is the only way I can see properly.
The visit did not last long after that episode.
After Mr Thompson had left, my mother told me that I spoiled a proper chance for marriage to a most suitable man because of me being stubborn, and wearing my glasses.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, Mabel, our cook asked me if I mind going to the bakery to pick up the order she had placed.
I walked to the bakery, and when I went into the store was greeted by a very pleasant young man.
After I told him what I wanted, he asked me if I worked for the Anderson s now.
No, I am Margaret Anderson.
O, please forgive me, I just presumed.
That s all right, you have a nice store here.
After he had told me that the business belonged to his parents, that he looked after it, because his dad was not in very good health.
We talked about baking, and he showed me around,  I liked him, and I was in no hurry to leave.
I loved being in the company of a real man, not like the wimp who had called on me.
Good thing a customer came in, to interrupt our conversation.
I said good bye to David and went home.
What a man, I think I could love a guy like that.</p>
<p>When I came home and gave Mabel the baking, she asked me what took me so long.
I had a great conversation with David, he sure is a nice guy.
That night at dinner, my parents mentioned I seem to be distracted.
Was I sorry I had spoiled my chance with Mr. Thompson.
No, I am not sorry, and I am looking forward to going back to school and finish the course.</p>
<p>When back at school, Ann asked me to tell her all about the man who came to call on me.
I gave her the complete story, and my mothers reaction.
So he did not like you wearing your glasses, how are you supposed to see?
The way he talked,  he thinks he is perfect, and I guess I am not.
Off course I had to tell her about David and how I enjoyed the trip to the bakery.
Ann laughed, Margaret, I think you are in love.</p>
<p>My course at the boarding school is finished, and now I am supposed to be a perfect lady.
On the first full day that I was home, I told my mother I was going to see my friend Linda.
But instead went to the bakery to see David.
When he saw me was all smiles, hello Margaret, it is so nice to see you again..
We had a long talk, and he asked me if I was going to the Dominion Day celebrations,
I told them I had never been there before, but I sure would like to go, and I made arrangements to meet him .</p>
<p>The next day when Linda came to visit me, I told her about David, and meeting him, and going to the town Dominion Day celebrations, and we would stay for the fireworks display.
Linda told me she had been at a fire works display, but could not see what people liked about them.
Could you not see the colorful explosions way up in the sky?
No, I could not.
Linda. If you cannot see that, I think you might need to wear glasses.
I have no problem reading and doing needlework, I can see just fine.
Well come to the window, can you see the clock on the church steeple?
No, I cannot, so I went to my dresser and got my first pair of glasses and told Linda to put the glasses on.
After Linda put the glasses on and she looked out of the window, could not believe how she could see
everything so nice and clear.
Oh,  Margaret I never realized how glasses can improve your vision that much, I think you are right,
I need to wear glasses.</p>
<p>When Linda and I went to meet David to go to the Dominion Day celebration,
Linda was wearing her new glasses, and kept on telling me how happy she was with her glasses, and how well she could see now.
We met David at the bakery, where he was waiting for us with his 2 wheeled carriage,
He helped us get seated and climbed aboard.
It did not take long to get to the fairground.
After tying up the horse, we walked to the area where all the games and food vendors were.
We met Peter a friend of David, he came with us and seemed to like Linda.
I had never seen some of the food items available, and asked David about them.
Most of these new foods were introduced at the Worlds Fair in St Louis in 1904.
Here is what they call pop corn, the next stand has hot dogs, a wiener on a bun, and there they are making cotton candy
David bought me a hot dog and after that some cotton candy, and I enjoyed my new food experience.
We played some games, and then settled in the open bleachers to watch the fire works.
After it was ended David drove me home in his carriage.
David thank you, this was the best time I ever had, and gave him a kiss.
He smiled, and kissed me, but we had to stop, when a carriage pulled up behind us, my parents came home.
I ran into the house to my bedroom.</p>
<p>The next day, I was asked how come, I was brought home in a carriage?
You told us you were going to see Linda.
Well Linda and I wanted to see the fire works, and when we left the fair grounds, a kind gentleman gave us a ride home.
Who was the gentleman?
His name is David, he and his dad have the bakery, where we are a customer.
He is a common trades man,
Well mother he is a gentleman, and a pleasant person, he even complimented me and Linda on being smart enough to wear glasses, so we could see properly, and that we looked very attractive wearing glasses.
Well, I think you can do better then a baker, I think there are some real gentlemen who might accept you when wearing glasses.
Now I could go and see David, because my mother knew.</p>
<p>I went to see David as often as I could, I was in love with him.
About six months later, David s father died, and now David had to run the bakery by himself.
I went to help him when I could, and looked after customers for him, when he could not leave the baking.
Working like that was sure a lot more fun, than spending all your time reading, knitting and sewing,.
Not long after I spend almost every day at the bakery,
David s mother was not in good health, and I would help her cook David s meals.</p>
<p>My mother did not like me spending that much time at the bakery, but my dad told her, this is just a phase Margaret is going through, she will get tired of it, when the right man comes along.</p>
<p>Six months later.</p>
<p>David had made arranged to meet Mr, and Mrs. Anderson to day, to ask for permission to marry their
daughter Margaret.
All dressed up and looking his best, David entered the room where Margaret s parents were waiting for him.
My father asked him if he could provide his daughter with a good home and sufficient money?
David assured my dad, that his daughter would be looked after to the best of his ability, and to be comfortable at all times.
I realize you and Margaret love each other, and I am sure you will look after her, so I give you permission to marry her, welcome to the family.
I was called into the room, when I came in and sat down, my dad told me David and I could get married.</p>
<p>In our church the bans were read for 3 weeks, before we could get married.
We had a small church wedding on a Saturday afternoon,
My brides maids were Ann and Linda, all of us girls wearing glasses.
David s best man was Peter.
After the wedding we drove in our carriages to my parents house for the wedding dinner.
David and I, stayed at our local hotel for our one day honeymoon.
We were up and ready to go at 5 o clock Monday morning, to bake bread and pastries, to be ready for our customers, when the store opened at 7 0 clock.
The start of a long and happy marriage, that was the lifestyle in the early 20 th century.</p>
