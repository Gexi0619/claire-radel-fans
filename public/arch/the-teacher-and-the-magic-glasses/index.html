          <p>The teacher, and the magic glasses.</p>
<p>After graduating, and having received my teaching certificate, I accepted a position at a school,
where I will be teaching grade 5.
I am really looking forward to teaching boys and girls at that age, why?
You will find out later.</p>
<p>It all started when I was about 5 years old, and I noticed, that when people wore glasses, everybody s eyes looked different.
Grandma and grandpa both wore glasses, that fascinated me.
Grandpa wears glasses, that made his eyes look much bigger, I did not really like that look.
When looking at grandma, her eyes looked so much smaller, nice and bright, as if they were in the end of a tunnel.
When looking at grandma s glasses, all I could see was, what looked like rings on the side, and then her her nice small blue eyes.
My mother wears glasses, her eyes look a smaller, and her lenses show some rings, I think, she looks beautiful.
Now I wonder what my eyes will look like, when I have start to wearing glasses.
I think everybody should wear glasses, then everybody, would be so much so much nicer to look at.</p>
<p>About two years later, when I was visiting at grandma s house, grandma told me, that up in the attic,
was an old trunk, with some old toys, and dolls, and some other things, when you find something you like, you can have it.
I opened the trunk, and there were some nice dolls, and doll s clothes, and an old shoe box.
After I took the lid of the shoe box, saw a very nice pair of gold framed glasses.
I put the glasses on, and noticed that, as soon as I put the glasses on, and looked around, could see everything so much better.
Everything I looked at, was so bright and clear.
There was an old mirror, and when I looked at myself wearing the glasses, sure liked the looks of me wearing glasses.
My eyes looked so nice behind the lenses, that I am sure, I want to wear glasses like that.
When I went downstairs and showed grandma the glasses, she told me, that she was not sure where the glasses came from, I don t think they were the first pair of glasses your mother wore.
I remember she started to wear glasses, when she was about your age.
Come to think of it, if I remember right, they are the first pair of , I ever tried, when I was a young girl, and that is the time, I started to wear glasses
Grandma asked me, can you see well, when wearing the glasses.
Yes, I can see everything so nice and clear clear, these glasses are magic, I love wearing them.
I wore the glasses the rest of the day, and grandma said, you look just like your mother, when she was your age, and started to wear glasses.</p>
<p>When I came home wearing the glasses, my mother wanted to know, where the glasses came from.
I told her,. about the glasses and where they came from, and how well I could see, when wearing the glasses.
She told me, that the glasses looked exactly like the ones, I found in the attic, when I was your age.
I remember, when I tried wearing the glasses, could see so much better.
That is, when Grandma had my eyes examined, and I started to wear glasses.
I never knew, what happened, to the glasses you are wearing now, and I am surprised to see them again.
We will make arrangements, for you to have an eye exam, I am sure, you will need to wear glasses.
I was glad, that she let me continue to wear the glasses, I love wearing them.</p>
<p>After my eye exam, I was prescribed glasses, like I expected.
My prescription read, right eye -1.25 left eye -1.00
Carefully, I put the old glasses in a safe place, I had a good idea how, sometime I might need the glasses again, and I also have a feeling, that there is something special about the glasses..
When my friends Cindy and Katie, came over, and saw me wearing glasses, wanted to know all about my glasses.
After trying my glasses, Cindy told me she likes the glasses, and would not mind having to wear them.
I showed her the glasses, that I had found in grandma s attic, and asked her if she wanted to wear them.
Cindy said, I would love to.
When Cindy, put the glasses on, and looked around, said these glasses are like magic, I can see everything so nice and clear, and kept wearing the glasses.
I told her, she could keep the glasses, until she got her own glasses, but I wanted the glasses returned.
Cindy wore the glasses home, and two weeks later, came to show me her new glasses, when she returned the glasses, she had borrowed.
The next time, Cindy and Katie were over to see me, Katie asked, if she could try the glasses, that Cindy wore, she would like to try wearing them.
I gave Katie the glasses, and after she put them on, and looked around said, these glasses are
great, everything I look at, is so nice and clear, I don t want to take the glasses off, and wore the glasses when she went home.</p>
<p>The next time I saw Katie, she came to return my glasses, and was wearing, new prescription glasses.
She thanked me, and told me, how she loves wearing her new glasses.
Now, I am thinking, that the glasses might be magic, you wear them, and you become myopic, and need to wear glasses, and when you star to wear your glasses, you love wearing them.
I am so happy to have the glasses, now I can get my wish, that I can make people myopic,
by letting them wear the glasses.
I was curious to find out, if the glasses would work on boys to, so I went to the field where they play baseball.
I got there just in time, to see poor Jimmy strike out again.
I went over to him, and suggested that if he wore the glasses, he would have no trouble seeing the ball coming, and hitting the ball.
At first he was not interested, but when his turn at bat came up, asked me if he could try the glasses.
When wearing the glasses, he had no trouble seeing the ball coming, and hitting a home run.
After that, he did not want to take the glasses off, and when he returned the glasses to me, looked so handsome, wearing his own new glasses.</p>
<p>Since the frames on the glasses, are a smaller size, I did not have any more chances to try them again, so I put them in my bottom dresses drawer.
I know for sure, I would like to try the glasses again, to find out if they really make people myopic.</p>
<p>I am in my last year of high school, and my prescription is now – 7.00.
My friends Katie and Cindy are in the -6.00 range, and still love wearing their glasses.
I have decided, I want to go to university, and become a teacher.</p>
<p>While studying at the university, to become a teacher, I had quite a few dates.
A girl wearing glasses, seemed to be just, what a lot of guys were looking for.
None of my dates, I am sorry to say, turned out to be the kind of person, I was looking for.
Time goes fast, and now I am in my last semester.
I am now looking for a teaching job, and have send out some applications.
It also was time for my annual eye exam.
When, I arrived at the optical office, the receptionist told me, that the optometrist, who always looked after me, had left, but I think you will like his replacement.
When I entered the examination room, was greeted by a very handsome, glasses wearing man, about my age.
Hello, I am Dr. James Brown, please call me Jim, I noticed from the records, your name is Amy, please be seated.
I really enjoyed the exam, Dr. Jim was very informative, and we had a very pleasant conversation.
My prescription increased ¾ of a diopter, which I did not mind, since I was planning on getting a new frame, and love the look of stronger lenses.
I must have been the last patient, because Dr, Jim cam out, to watch the optician, take some measurements, and then congratulated me, on the good looking frame I had selected.</p>
<p>Two days later, when I went to pick up my glasses, Dr. Jim looked after me.
He told me, that the optician had to leave early, and he would fit my glasses for me.
I loved it, his hands touching my face, it was so arousing.
When he finished, told me how fantastic I looked, and that he would very much like to take a beautiful,
glasses wearing lady like me, out for dinner.
I told him, it would be a pleasure to have dinner, with a handsome, glasses wearing doctor.</p>
<p>We had a very enjoyable dinner, and realize we both have a glasses fetish, for medium to high range myopia, and decided to continue our enjoyable conversation the next weekend.
When Jim came to get me for my date, I almost fainted when I saw his glasses.
He was wearing a pair of very strong lenses, that showed a lot of rings, and made his eyes look small.
Jim, I love the looks of your glasses, tell me about them.
These are -14.00 lenses, which I wear over contact lenses, to give me proper vision.
Looking at your eyes, reminds me of my grand mother, I was always fascinated, by the looks of her eyes, behind her strong lenses.
What a night we had, I loved looking at Jim s stronger glasses, and of course trying to wear the glasses, was so exciting.</p>
<p>I now, have graduated, and accepted a position, to teach grade 5 students.
At that age, quite a few are close or ready to need vision correction, and after they start wearing glasses look so pretty.
To day is the first day of school, and when my students came into the room, I had a chance to look at all of them.
There are 25 students in my class, 14 girls, and 11 boys.
Three of the girls wear glasses, and one of the boys, only one girl wears glasses for myopia, all the other glasses wearers are hyperopic.
After observing my students for a few days, I am sure, about four of them, soon will need vision correction.
I knew, that now, my magic glasses were going to be needed.
The next day in class, I talked about vision, and eye exams.
I showed the class the first pair of glasses that I wore, and how they had improved my vision.
I have the glasses here in my desk, you can try them, if you have trouble seeing the writing on the black board.
I like wearing glasses, because they give me perfect vision.</p>
<p>To day, Jenny told me, that she has trouble seeing what is written on the black board, and asked me if she could try my first pair glasses, to see if they improved her vision.
When she put the glasses on, told me right away, how she could see everything nice and clear now.
She did not want to take the glasses off., but I told her she could not take the glasses home, but I would give her a note for her parents, that she should have an eye exam.
Jenny complained that when she took the glasses off, everything in the distance looked fuzzy.
I told her ,that is why she needed to wear glasses.
About a week later Jenny was wearing glasses, and told me she loves wearing them.
Not long after, Ashley asked me if she could try the glasses, and by the time the Christmas break came,
three more girls were wearing glasses.</p>
<p>On one of my dates with Jim, he told me, he had examined the eyes of 4 of my students,
What really surprised him, was that all of them, had the identical prescription of -1.25 for the right and – 1.00 for the left eye.
They had told him, that I would let them try wearing my first pair of glasses, and after they had worn the glasses, noticed that when they took the glasses off, everything in the distance looked fuzzy.
So, I told Jim the story of the magic glasses.
My grandmother after wearing the glasses, became myopic, so did my mother, and so did I.
Everybody who wears the glasses, will be myopic, but also love wearing glasses.
Only the students who think they have a vision problem, will ask me, if they can try the glasses.
I am sure a few of the boys will ask me, to try the glasses, when the baseball season starts,
when they have trouble with their hitting, when they have trouble seeing the ball coming.
The only problem I have, is that the frame of the glasses is not very big, and will only fit
children, that is why I like to teach grade 5.
Jim was interested to see the glasses, he would like to find out more about them.
I told him, I would bring the glasses to his office on the weekend.</p>
<p>As promised, I took the glasses to Jim s office.
He looked them over, and said, they look like non prescription lenses.
When checking the glasses on the lensometer, told me I can t believe it, I cannot get a reading.
I have never experienced anything like this.
We were interrupted, when the optician told Jim, a girl asked to see him.</p>
<p>Doctor, my name is Grace, I have a problem, I want to wear prescription glasses.
My boyfriend loves the looks of glasses, and after trying some frames, I like the way I look wearing glasses.
Can you help me, at last weeks exam my vision was fine, but you will have to do something, so I can wear prescription glasses.
I told Jim, now you can try the magic glasses, and see for yourself that they work.
Jim, was hesitant, taking the glasses.
Well, if you are sure you want to wear prescription glasses, put these glasses on, and come back in about an hour, and I will give you an eye exam.
When the girl put the glasses on, started to smile.
Doctor, I can t believe it, everything I look at, looks so nice and clear.
Thank you, I will be back in an hour.</p>
<p>An hour later, Grace came back with a big smile on her face, I love wearing the glasses.
Well let me check your vision, and Jim started the exam.
When Jim was finished, told Grace you need to wear glasses, you are myopic now.
Thank you Doctor, I am so happy, thank you.
Jim gave me back the magic glasses, and said I can t believe it, at last weeks exam Grace had 20/20 vision, today her prescription is the same as all the others, right eye -1.25, left eye -1.00., and she loves wearing glasses.
I intend to keep using the glasses, when I think, a student needs vision correction,.
There is in my opinion, nothing nicer to look at then a person wearing glasses.
I intend to be a teacher for a long time, and use the MAGIC GLASSES,</p>
