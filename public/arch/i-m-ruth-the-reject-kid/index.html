        <div class="article-content max-w-prose mb-20">
          <p>My name is Ruth I&rsquo;m 17 years old,both my parents were killed in a plane crash and I was badly injured when I was 8 years old.
My aunts and uncles did not want to look after me so I live in an orphanage.We all wear the same blue tops and skirts and dark navy coats.
When we grew out of them we had to go to see the house mother,who looked in the store room for the next size,then our old clothes are washed and ironed and put in store the the next child that needs them,so we all look alike
Well that&rsquo;s not correct, I should say dressed alike.
I&rsquo;m known as the reject kid
Nobody wants to adopt me or even be my foster parent.
I have been turned down 12 times.for foster care and 3 times for adoption 
You might wonder why.
I&rsquo;m not a bad girl and I work hard and gets good marks.
But as soon as they look at me they say “we don&rsquo;t want that disabled girl”
I have not told you yet but I&rsquo;m very short sighted and have a Lazy left eye.
The glasses that I have to wear don&rsquo;t help,they are small round blue metal frames with wire hooks that go over my ears,and I have a small box that I try to hide in my bra it has a pink cord that attaches to a ugly plug that goes into my right ear to help me hear from that side,but I can&rsquo;t hear anything from the other ear,as they wont give me a hearing aid for that side.
Tomorrow I go to town for my yearly eye and hearing tests,
Part of me wants to go and the other part of me is to afraid,I know my eye sight has got worse so it will be nice to see better,but I know my glasses will look even uglier.</p>
<p>Only one more person to go in I&rsquo;m very excited there is a nice new lady here today,much younger than the grumpy old man.
.
“Well Ruth there seems to be a very big change in your vision,why did you not come in last year”
“Matron was to busy to bring me
“That&rsquo;s just not good enough I must have words with her,your lazy eye has got much worse,have you been doing your exercises”
“Nobody told me to do any,honest I hate my lazy eye,I would have done them if I had been told”.
“You sit and wait there I need to talk to matron”
“Please don&rsquo;t get me into trouble,I don&rsquo;t want to be punished again”</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s all arranged now you are to come to see me on your OWN next week, there is a lot I want to talk about to you in private,but just tell matronis a problem and I need to do a lot mor tests.</p>
<p>The next Morning all the girls 16 and above were called for a meeting in the empty classroom.
“Good morning girls the orphanage has been lucky to get a sponsor to help with the running of the school
“One of the top manufacturers of cigarettes Woodbines, Will pay for 2 extra teachers and refit 2 old empty classrooms”
“All girl aged 16 and over will be taught how to smoke ,and be provided with 5 cigarettes a day and this room will be turned into a smoking room”.
Smoking will be compulsory after breakfast,mid morning break, lunchtime,afternoon break and after evening meal. 
“Since the war smoking has become very fashionable among young lady&rsquo;s so this is a golden opportunity for you to help the school and look grown up and  join the latest fashion” </p>
<p>“Ms Pearson is there top rep,notice how slim and graceful she looks,she now Smokes 20 a day it helps her to keep slim”</p>
<p>All the girls were excited and wanted to be first to try.
First they were taught to hold the cigarettes in a ladylike manner.
Then Ms Pearson picked  2 girls out and showed them how to light their cigarettes,between coughing and giggling all the girls were now smoking.
The bell went for start of lessons the girls were told to put their cigarettes in a Sand bucket and go to their classrooms.
Ruth remembered her father smoking,so she soon became the best smoker in the class&rsquo;s she had quickly learnt to deep inhale,She found it comforting,and it was as if her father was back with her.</p>
<p>Today she was on her way to see the eye doctor,she was very nervous,she found a quiet spot in the park and light a cigarette,she took half a dozen deep drags on it,hardly exhaling, Ms Pearson told her to chew on a mint after so her breath would smell nicer,</p>
<p>“Good morning Ruth,you look happier today”
“Let&rsquo;s get on with your eye tests first”
“I expect you have realised that your eye sight has got a lot worse, when did you last have your lens changed.
“3 years ago”
“Last time I came the eye doctor spoke to matron after testing my eyes he decided not to give me a new prescription, even though I could see further down the chart after he put lots of lens in the test frame”
“Why are you still at the orphanage” 
“Nobody wants me because I&rsquo;m disabled that&rsquo;s why they all call me the reject kid.
After 30 mins the doctor said I&rsquo;m going to ring the matron and tell her I have many more tests to do and you are staying here tonight,I&rsquo;m not happy about the way you are being treated there”
“Also I rang social services, your not in trouble,they are coming to talk to us tomorrow”
“This is your new prescription”
R -21.50 -2.50 130 
L  -15.00 -3.75  90 Prism out 10
Add 3.75 
“I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s the best we can do for your left eye”
“I&rsquo;m going to make you 3 different pairs of glasses”
“First pair will be with your distance prescription”
“Second pair is for reading and studying 
“Oooooo won&rsquo;t people think I&rsquo;m an old granny if I need to change glasses for reading as well”
“Forget other people you need to see”
“The third pair has a fogged right lens you will only see light and shapes from it, you will have to get used to making your left eye work,these are to be worn when you are school or studying,that means before and after school and ALL weekend”
 “I think it&rsquo;s time you had a nicer pair of glasses,we have some new lady&rsquo;s pink plastic NHS glasses in now”.
“The pair with the fogged lens will be ready in about a hour for you you can start wearing them straight away”
“Are you feeling ill you are shaking”
I&rsquo;m sorry but I need a cigarette it&rsquo;s 4 hours since I smoked”
The doctor looked shocked.
“How much do you smoke Ruth”
“About 10 a day,or more if  some of the other girls that not like smoking give them to me so they won&rsquo;t get into trouble also it takes away the pain of loosing my parents and the bullying”
“Ok let&rsquo;s go into the sunroom and have a coffee and smoke together”
“Do you smoke as well doctor”
“Yes of course Ruth. All professional lady&rsquo;s do now”
“You make the coffee Ruth while go and get your new glasses for you”</p>
<p>“Please don&rsquo;t get upset Ruth I know the right lens is very thick and the left lens also has a lots of lines running down it but they will help see much better and to straighten your left eye,we have put a stick on fresnel len, later we will get you a new lens with prism built into it 
“Thank you so much doctor I love the pink plastic frames and I can see so much more now with my left eye, does it look straighter now?”
“It so nice smoking with you,This cigarette tastes so much nicer than the ones school give us”
“You had better go to bed now Ruth I will show you where you can sleep,breakfast will be at 7 am,look in the wardrobe and choose some nice cloth to put on”</p>
<p>“Good morning Ruth, you look very pretty this morning,did you sleep well”
“Yes thank you doctor,
“After breakfast we will get your hearing checked”</p>
<p>“That didn&rsquo;t talk long Ruth,your right hearing aids looks rather old. This is a new one for you it&rsquo;s a little more powerful ,so that should help you,but I&rsquo;m.sorry but you are profoundly Deaf in your left ear now”
“What does profoundly deaf mean”
“It mean you have very little useful hearing in that ear”
“The NHS only provide people with one hearing aid,but In Your case I&rsquo;m going to make an exception”
“This box is a little bigger so it&rsquo;s best to wear it strapped around your waist the microphone hangs around your neck from this cord and the other has the pink button that we push into your ear like the other side”
“You won&rsquo;t hear much in that ear but it should help with some sounds”</p>
<p>“I must work now,you can go and make yourself a coffee,there is a packet of cigarettes on the side table for you”
“When the lady from social services arrives I will bring her up,make sure the lounge is tidy please,you will find some lipstick in the bathroom cupboard”</p>
<p>“Hello Ruth, my world you have changed you look very grown up now”
“I like your new glasses,are they the new NHS style,lucky you mine are still these old black NHS round ones with the temple hooks on them,
“YES I only got them yesterday  I can see so much better with them,and look I have 2 hearing aids now, the doctor has been so wonderful to me”
“But I scared I have to go back tomorrow and I&rsquo;m sure I will be bullied”
“Ruth you take Miss Blackford into the sun room,she wants to talk to you,
and offer her a cigarette,you know we&rsquo;re they are,when you light yours light one for me as well”.
“Thank you Ruth,I smoke rather a lot my work is very stressful,you look a very confident young lady,I did not know you smoked”
“Yes I started a few weeks ago, I love it I feel grown up”
“Doctor Hellewell has told me all about what has been happening to you,she has said that you could stay her with her if you would like to ,she would foster you for the next 6 months till you are 18  then you must decide what you want to do, maybe you could stay with the doctor longer while you are still studying but that is for you to think about  ”
“Will you really foster me Doctor,can I Stay with you “
“Yes if you would like to ,we will find a new school for you” 
“Yes Please doctor,, I will work hard and not be any trouble””
“I Brought these papers with me for us all to sign,,just Incase “
“Just wait a minute while I put my reading glasses on,this print is very small,that&rsquo;s why I keep them on this cord, here&rsquo;s your copy Ruth you had better read it,to make sure your happy with it before signing”
“Thank you Miss Blackford,but the print is much to small it&rsquo;s all just a blur I can&rsquo;t read it with these new glasses”.
“Doctor Hellewell told me they are 5 diopter stronger than my old glasses and I can only see out of my lazy left eye as the the right eye has this fogged lens so I just see light and colours”
“I will be getting reading glasses as well,I thought I was to young to wear reading glasses as well, but I don&rsquo;t mine now that I see you wearing yours”
“I forgot to tell you Ruth I put them on the kitchen table for you on my way up“
“Wow they are like Miss Blackfords they are a lovely tortoiseshell colour,I don&rsquo;t mind they are the round style”
“Why is the right lens blacked out and not fogged like my other glasses”
“It will be easier for you to read close if you only can see out of your left eye,reading will strain your lazy eye more so I have increased the prism to 15 out “
“Wow the print is so big and clear now,you are so clever doctor”</p>
<p>“O Doctor I never knew you needed reading glasses and you got the same style of frames as us”
“Yes Ruth I&rsquo;m Very long sighted, I wear these new contact lens,they are very large and cover all my eye,they are made of hard plastic,one day I hope they will make much smaller contacts and softer.They are very painful some time”
“I need extra help to read so I wear these over my contacts”.
“Later today I will show you my other glasses that I wear when I don&rsquo;t have these contacts in”
“I think we should celebrate,there is a bottle of bubbly over there”
“What are they Doctor”
“Baby cigars the Spanish call them Cigarillos I will light yours for you Ruth”
“I love the smell and taste, I feel like Winston Churchill”
“Can we all keep our reading glasses on then I won&rsquo;t be the reject kid,
“Yes of course we can Ruth it&rsquo;s your special day”.</p>
<p>“I had better go now,I will collect all your personal things after lunch,and just tell them you have been fostered,but I won&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;re you are”</p>
<p>“That&rsquo;s all finished for the day,shall we go to the city and buy you some new clothes and some makeup of your own”  
“Will you wear your glasses please doctor then I won&rsquo;t feel different”
“Yes of course Ruth if that what you want,I think you had better stop calling me doctor now my name is Carol”
“My glasses are on the dressing table get the ones in the red case please and put the other pair in my bag,I need the others to see to write the cheques”
“Wow doctor sorry I mean Carol,you have the same frames as me but in clear plastic colour, they look lovely on you”
“Why are your lens so different to mine”
“Mine are so thick at the edge but your bulge out in the middle”
“Yes Ruth that because you are short sighted,and I&rsquo;m long sight,you can go down to our lab next week and you can see how we make them”
“I&rsquo;m plus 21 in my right eye and plus 19 in my left eye,and my  reading glasses are plus 25 and plus 23 with a prism of out 12 in each eye”
“Please can I see your reading glasses ”
“Yes I know Ruth they look like 2 Hugh paperweights”
“I did not know they made the older style round NHS frames in pink will you put them on,wow I wish I had Hugh eyes like that”
“I was teased and bullied at school like you, I was called the frog eyed girl” 
“So I did not like wearing glasses so I had to sit at the front of the class the see, but that was ok as nobody ever knew that it help me to hear as well”. 
“Do you have hearing aids like me as well Carol”
“Yes but I only wear them when I go to meetings abroad” 
“Please please wear them now”
“I don&rsquo;t know Ruth,nobody here has ever seen me wearing them,I am very good at lip reading”
“Please Please Please, Then people will think you my older sister,and I not come from the orphanage”
“Where are they Carol”
“In the top draw over there, I think,it&rsquo;s about 3 year since I wore them”
“If you really want me to wear them you had better put new batteries in them”.
“Can I pretend to be the audiologist and fit them in your ears for you”
“Ok if that will make you happy the box with the red sticker is for my right ear.You had better change my glasses for me first,I can&rsquo;t see very far in my reading glasses then put the right button in first”
“You will need to undo the 2 top buttons of my blouse next”
“Your hands are shaking Ruth you had better light us both a cigarette”
Carol and Ruth both took long deep drags on thier cigarettes,inhaling ever deeper with each drag.
“Your bra is much fuller than mine do I put one hearing aid box in each cup’
“Yes push each breast to the side and put the boxes in the middle”
“You will need 2 hands so you better leave your cigarette in your mouth”
Ruth was nearly down to the but end of her cigarette but was still frantically trying to get the last fix from it.
Carol lent forward and took the but end out of Ruth mouth.
“Here you better finish mine”
Ruth loved the taste of Carol lipstick on the cigarette.
“Ok now the other side’
“I wish I had big soft  breasts like yours and big eyes Carol”</p>
<p>“Right shall we walk to the park and have a snack there then get a taxi to the city”
“Why don&rsquo;t you have a car Carol Can&rsquo;t  you drive”
“Yes I can drive and I used to have a car,but my eyesight has got a lot worse in the last 2 year,I&rsquo;m now classified as partially sighted so I had to return my driving licence”
“O am I partially sighted as well”
“Yes Ruth but don&rsquo;t get upset,I have much stronger lens if you need them”
“Thank you Carol,will I need a white cane when I&rsquo;m older”</p>
<p>Both enjoyed the shopping and Carol bought some new clothes and shoes and a 32 C cup Padded bra for Ruth,so there was plenty of space to hide the hearing aid box beside her tiny breasts.
“Can you buy a new bra for yourself this style is the same as mine,what size do you need 
“38DD”</p>
<p> “Thank you so much Carol for a lovely day I not been this happy since my parents died”
“It&rsquo;s so nice to hear a little from my right ear,and I don&rsquo;t feel so different now you are wearing your healing aids,thank you”
“It&rsquo;s ok Ruth,It&rsquo;s the first time I have ever worn them outside and never been shopping wearing them,and I must admit it does help,lip reading is very tiring”
“I suppose I was to vain to wear them ,but you have been an inspiration to me”</p>
<p>“Next morning Ruth woke early and layed the Breakfast table”
Carol rushed in “have you seen my contact lens,I thought I had put the on the dressing table after I took them out”
Ruth pretend  to look for them,but she had hidden them because she wanted Carol to wear her glasses.
“You look lovely like that I think you look prettier wearing glasses,I love having a older sister”
“What are you doing Ruth,I can&rsquo;t wear them nobody but you knows I&rsquo;m deaf 
“Well you said you could hear better yesterday wearing your hearing aids”
“O ok I don&rsquo;t have time to argue with you”</p>
<p>Carol was a few minutes late arriving and the reception had already opened.
“Good morning doctor,I like your new glasses they suit you,they are a good advert for the new NHS frames”
As Carol went to walk into her office she heard the reception say to lab technician,thank god she started wearing hearing aids I won&rsquo;t have to keep repeating myself all day,we all Knew she was deaf,the only person she was fooling was herself”
Carol turned and smiled at them both.</p>
