          <p>&ldquo;Tell me more about this fetish of yours Mr. Smith.&rdquo; Dr. Abrams said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well doctor, for as long as I can remember I have been attracted to nearsighted ladies.&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be to the exclusion of any other ladies?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>“It wasn&rsquo;t that way at first. But as the years have passed by I have reached a point where I don&rsquo;t even take a second look at a lady unless she is wearing strong minus glasses.&quot; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is a problem because&hellip;&hellip;.?&rdquo; Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it isn&rsquo;t really a problem doctor, but I know it isn&rsquo;t right. I shouldn&rsquo;t be this way.&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you harming anyone?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. The only one I am harming is me, with my constant searching for the perfect nearsighted lady.&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever found this perfect nearsighted lady?&rdquo; came his next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I had a few times, but then I would find another one that caught my eye.&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you also have commitment issues as well.&rdquo; He stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of issues Doctor. That is why I finally decided I should seek professional help.&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t really seem like such a big issue, but if you feel I can help you I will see you at the same time next week.&rdquo; Dr Abrams answered.</p>
<p>I made another appointment for the following week and left the office. All the way home on the subway I wondered if I was doing the right thing by reaching out for help.  When I was younger my attraction to myopia was a small thing, something that only surfaced infrequently. As I aged it gradually started to take over more of my thoughts and my life.  When I was younger I could easily make love to an attractive lady as long as I imagined her wearing strong glasses.  But now the imagining no longer worked. If she didn&rsquo;t wear double digit minus lenses in her glasses I couldn&rsquo;t experience any arousal at all.  Even wearing very strong minus glasses over plus contact lenses myself no longer gave me the same feeling of sexual arousal that it formerly had.</p>
<p>Finally I had enough. I realized that the only way I was going to get over this fetish was if I got professional help.  I hadn&rsquo;t given the doctor too much detail about my fetish when we started to talk, but chose to reveal it in bits and pieces so that I wouldn&rsquo;t shock him too much. Or maybe I wanted to bring it all out gradually so that he wouldn&rsquo;t think I was a total jerk and a real mental case.</p>
<p>As the time came for my appointment the following week I agonized over going in wearing my strongest minus glasses over my corresponding contact lenses. Finally I decided that seeing me wearing GOC before I discussed it would be too big a step, so I reluctantly decided to again appear in front of Dr. Abrams bare eyed.</p>
<p>I knew the receptionist was Dr. Abrams wife, but as I checked in that day something caught my attention. She was looking at an invoice on the computer screen and she brought her head fairly close to the screen, much as someone who was quite nearsighted would do. I didn&rsquo;t think a lot about it, but just figured that she was nearsighted and wore contact lenses.</p>
<p>A half hour session isn&rsquo;t really long enough to get into a lot of details. I did discuss my wearing of strong minus glasses over plus contacts, but instead of admonishing me Dr. Abrams surprised me a little with a number of questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if you wear plus contact lenses of the proper strength you can wear very strong minus glasses and see perfectly?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you can, but sometimes it takes a few tries to get the combination just right. It would be better if a person could go to an eye doctor and order the plus contacts. Then the eye doctor could fine tune the prescription for the glasses without any guesswork.” I replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take it that you don&rsquo;t go to an eye doctor for your combinations. How did you do it?” my doctor questioned.</p>
<p>“That was a long long time ago, when I was just beginning to fan the flames of my fetish. Dr. Abrams.  At first I took my own prescription and added -3D to it and ordered a pair of glasses using a prescription I had made up myself. Then I ordered stronger and stronger glasses until I reached a point where the glasses I was ordering were so strong I really couldn&rsquo;t wear them.  I had originally done this so that I could be wearing a pair of reasonably strong looking glasses around the city, so that when I was in a mall or a store I could converse with any ladies I saw who wore strong glasses.  By now my glasses were so strong I really couldn&rsquo;t see well enough out of them to spot any ladies wearing strong glasses.” I said.</p>
<p>“So that was a little self defeating. What was your next step?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“I had been checking out dumpsters behind optical lens labs to see if I could get any strong lenses or discarded frames from them. My little hobby was starting to be a bit pricey, and I thought this might be a good way to cut down on my expenses.  A couple of times I spotted discarded vials of contact lenses but I passed them by.  I was curious though and finally I started to take any of the contact lenses I found home to check them out.  It turned out that most of these lenses were warranty or replacement items, and they were ripped or were not the correct power, nor were they the correct size for me.  I had found that I needed 8.8 x 14.2 for my eyes and there were some I could wear.  Most of these lenses were low minus, but there was a pair of +5D lenses that when I put them in my eyes made me almost like I was very nearsighted. I tried some of my glasses over them, and finally I was able to see fairly well with some of the stronger pairs. My next step was to scout out the dumpsters that were used by a couple of contact lens distributors. I was able to attain quite a reasonable selection of plus contacts that I could wear.” I told him.</p>
<p>“Is that what you still do?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“Not anymore.  The lenses I now use are too strong to be found in any dumpster.  Now I order them from a couple of lens suppliers that I found on the internet that do not verify prescriptions. And my special lenses that I wear with my strongest glasses were obtained for me by a retired friendly optician who has the same fetish that I do.” I answered.</p>
<p>“Our time is up for today.  Will I see you next week?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“I will be back. I want to change myself and I need your help.  What would you think if I wore a pair of strong glasses next week?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You can do whatever you want. A Psychiatrist is trained to be non judgmental.” Dr. Abrams said.</p>
<p>So off I went to do my usual weekly tasks. Since I retired I don&rsquo;t have a lot to do, but I am generally able to find enough to keep me as busy as I want to be.  Being retired does have one disadvantage though. It gives me far too much time to think about things that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about – like ladies who wear strong minus glasses.  And another thing that I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing is my afternoon walk at the mall.  My excuse of course is that walking at the mall helps keep me healthy.  But sometimes these walks get interrupted by the sight of a nice high minus lady and I end up walking around the mall in the direction she is going. I am pretty careful not to be spotted, so I have learned to sometimes walk slightly ahead of the lady I am scoping out.  Following tends to make them suspicious, so it helps to pass them once in a while and walk ahead a bit. Then if I make a side venture into a store this will allow her to get back in front.  Sometimes she enters a store that I have no reason to be in – such as a ladies shoe store, or a perfume shop, so I drop back and hang around for a while. Or, if I have lost interest by then I go back to my mall walk. It helps to pass the time, but I know I am going to have to stop this nonsense if I ever want Dr. Abrams to cure me.</p>
<p>Finally it was time for my weekly session with Dr. Abrams. I was debating whether to wear my -25D glasses or my very strong -40D pair, and finally I decided that the -40D pair would be a bit of overkill, as they do look very strong. But actually my -25D pair looks pretty strong as well, although they are not myodiscs but are biconcave 1.9 index glass in a small eye size. The edge thickness of these lenses are exactly 5/16”, and a couple of knowledgeable opticians have guessed the power of these lenses at around -14 or -15D, so they do look nice and thin. Of course there are lots of power rings and the cut in of my face is probably about 1” when I measure from the edge of my face outside the lenses to where the same place on my face shows up in the lens. If the lenses were wider the cut in would be even more noticeable, but because about 1/2” of my face shows up beyond the edge of the frame there is only around 1/2” of space showing up through the lens.  A really observant optically obsessed person should have been able to look at these glasses and guessed a much higher prescription.  But I feel that they look nice on me and I feel comfortable wearing them in public. So I put in my contacts and placed my -25D glasses on my nose.</p>
<p>I enjoyed riding the subway wearing my glasses. Although, I never seem to feel that anyone is looking at me anymore. I suppose that no one is interested in an old gray haired man with strong glasses.  I walked to Dr. Abrams office building and rode the elevator up by myself.  When I checked in with Mrs. Abrams I thought she gave me more of a look than normal, but I figured that was my imagination.</p>
<p>Dr. Abrams was quite interested in my glasses and he asked a number of questions before we finally got around to talking about my fetish.</p>
<p>“I am actually quite upset with myself today Doctor.” I said.</p>
<p>“Why is that Mr. Smith?”</p>
<p>“I write stories for my own pleasure and I send them to an internet site that posts them so that people who have a similar fetish as I do can read them.  Since I started writing the stories I suppose I have written a couple of hundred short stories about ladies who wear very strong minus glasses.  Sometimes I try to write something different – a story with a twist, or a story that isn&rsquo;t my usual same old same old girl needs glasses gets them and the glasses get stronger and stronger and finally she is wearing real coke bottles. Then she finds a guy who says he loves her for herself but he actually has a strong glasses fetish so he marries her and they live happily ever after.  I started a nice story the other day about a young lady who gets sent home from school with a note from the teacher telling her mom that the daughter might need glasses. Then I wrote about how the mom actually needed glasses as well, and I was going to end the story with both mother and daughter wearing glasses that were just a normal strength. But I couldn&rsquo;t help myself and the mother had an increase so that she had to wear her glasses all the time. And then the daughter had a number of increases and ended up wearing pretty strong glasses.” I replied.</p>
<p>“That isn&rsquo;t a problem. Just go back and change the story.” Dr. Abrams said.</p>
<p>“I can&rsquo;t doctor. I read the story over and over and I like it the way it is. It would destroy the story in my mind if I changed it now.” I answered.</p>
<p>“I can&rsquo;t do much about that. If you can&rsquo;t help yourself I can&rsquo;t help you. But I want to ask you a favor. I think you told me that your glasses were around -25D. Would you let my wife try on your glasses?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“She won&rsquo;t be able to see a thing through them.” I replied.</p>
<p>“I think she will. Her own glasses are around that power but she won&rsquo;t wear her glasses because she thinks that they look awful.” He said.</p>
<p>“Certainly she can try them on.  I would rather leave my contact lenses in so that I could wear them home, but I suppose if I stayed on the couch or in a chair I could do without them while she tried them.” I told him.</p>
<p>He went out into the reception area and came back right away. A few minutes later his wife came in.  She had taken out her contact lenses and was wearing a pair of very thick myodiscs.  The lenses appeared to be done in regular plastic and were about 5/8” thick. They were mounted in an oval gold frame that could be considered a unisex frame, and for a change they were not lenticular lenses – just straight myodiscs with a plano base and the bowl was ground into a plano rear base. She sat down and we traded glasses.  My glasses are actually OD -23.50 x -1.50 x 90 and OS -24.75D. Her glasses seemed slightly weaker, and I couldn&rsquo;t tell if she had any astigmatism, or what plane it was on, but at least I could see enough from her glasses that I didn&rsquo;t feel anxious to get my own back.</p>
<p>“These are very nice. And I can see a bit better with these than I can with my glasses. I can see better with my contacts, but that isn&rsquo;t surprising because my glasses are old and I need to have them updated.”  Letticia Abrams told me.</p>
<p>“Is Mr. Smith our last patient for the day Letticia?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“Yes he is John. Why?” Letticia asked.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking that he could help you order a new pair of glasses. He told me that he ordered those glasses from the internet. You have your new prescription with you do you not?&rdquo; John asked.</p>
<p>“I do have my prescription, but is it a good idea to order them from the internet?” Letticia asked me.</p>
<p>“You can order the same pair from your optician, but if you do they will likely be about 4 times more expensive.” I replied.</p>
<p>“Money isn&rsquo;t a real problem, but I just want to make sure I get a pair I like.” Letticia replied.</p>
<p>“I am willing to help you if you are willing to take a chance.” I said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Abrams and I then spent some time on the computer looking at a number of frame choices and finally we found a nice pewter colored wire frame that wasn&rsquo;t oval, nor was it rectangular. It was more like a modified aviator style that had much softer angles and was actually a female version that was very similar to mine.  The lens size was nice and small, and I measured her pd at 62mm.  The overall width of the frame was 112mm and, like my frame, was slightly smaller than the width of her face.  We placed the order, and I got a look at her most recent prescription.  Her prescription was OD -24.50 x -1.00 x 180 and – 24.50 x -0.75 x 90. She had just a little stronger prescription than I did, but could see quite well with my glasses.</p>
<p>After we finished I walked back to the subway and went home. I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about what a lucky man Mr. Abrams was to have such an attractive highly nearsighted wife. Why does it always happen that the guys without a fetish always get the highly myopic women?</p>
<p>The following week Mrs. Abrams was again wearing her contacts. She had told me that her contacts had been bothering her a lot lately and that was why she wanted a decent looking pair of glasses. I had again worn my -25D glasses, and she remarked that she could hardly wait until her new glasses got there, and she hoped that they would look as good on her as mine looked on me.</p>
<p>Dr. Abrams and I talked about a number of different things that day.  He remarked that he had found the website where my stories were posted by searching for “Dave Smith eyeglass fetish”. He told me that his first google search turned up a website called vision and specs, and then he checked out some of the links on the home page. The links lead him to Bobby&rsquo;s site and when he clicked on stories by specs4ever he found out that this was me.</p>
<p>“That is funny Doctor. The Dave Smith that you found on Vision and Specs was not me, although he and I have corresponded. But by finding Vision and Specs you were lead to me. I suppose I should have told you that Specs4ever was my internet name and it would have made it easier on you.” I replied.</p>
<p>“It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I have read some of your short stories though, and I have enjoyed them. I can see what you mean about many of them having a common thread, but really most authors find a niche and a rhythm and write accordingly.  The story line is often much the same, and only the location and the characters differ. Look at John D. Mac Donald with the Travis Mc Gee series. Or for that matter look at Lee Child and his Jack Reacher novels.  The base premise of the story is always the same.” Dr. Abrams said.</p>
<p>“So am I looking for too much when I say I want to write stories that are different?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Have you tried to write different stories?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have, but I can&rsquo;t seem to get anywhere.  I have tried to write a few gay and lesbian or transgender stories, but I am straight, and this is foreign matter to me.  I have tried to write a couple of motorcycle stories because I am also a motorcycle enthusiast, but then I end up with a story about a guy named Harley Davidson who is blind as a bat without his thick glasses.  I just can&rsquo;t seem to escape from this fetish Doctor.” I replied.</p>
<p>“Our time is up for this week again Dave. You don&rsquo;t mind me calling you Dave do you?” Dr. Abrams asked.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s the name I go by. Why should I mind?” I queried.</p>
<p>“If you feel comfortable with it, you can call me John.” John said.</p>
<p>“I feel comfortable with it John. I was just calling you Dr. Abrams out of respect.  I will see you again next week then.” I said.</p>
<p>The following week when I went back Letticia Abrams was wearing her new glasses. She looked fantastic.  And she was thrilled with her eyesight with the glasses on. She told me that she had a little trouble getting used to the fact that the front curve was now slightly concave, but the glasses had arrived in the mail the previous afternoon, and after a few hours of wear she felt she was seeing quite well.  And then when she put them on first thing in the morning everything was perfect.</p>
<p>John couldn&rsquo;t stop thanking me for helping his wife. I was beginning to think that if he didn&rsquo;t stop there would be no time for him to help me with my problems, but finally we got around to talking about me.</p>
<p>“You know Dave, if you really want to get away from your fetish I think you should stop doing GOC.” John said.</p>
<p>“You are probably right. And I suppose I should quite writing my stories and stop walking around the mall looking for nearsighted ladies.  And while I am at it I should also delete all the pictures I have on my computer of ladies who are wearing glasses.” I replied.</p>
<p>“If you want me to help you I think that would be a good way for you to start helping yourself.” John said.</p>
<p>“But it has taken me years of writing, and collecting to build up my collection.  Can&rsquo;t you help me feel a little bit better about myself without having me destroy everything?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Think about what you want for a week.  But promise me that you won&rsquo;t do anything about destroying things until we talk again next week.” John said.</p>
<p>I agreed and went on my way.  John refused to charge me for the visit because of my assistance in getting his wife a new pair of glasses, so I felt a little better about that.  This was one time that my fetish had helped someone.  All week long I thought and thought about what John had said. I spent a lot of time going over all my pictures, and the thought of having to get rid of them almost brought me to tears. I also correspond with a couple of young ladies who wear very strong glasses, and I knew that if I wanted to put my fetish to bed I would have to end my correspondence.  There would be no more visiting internet sites about vision, and no more ordering very strong glasses or contacts over the internet. My glasses collection would have to go.  It would be a complete change in my life. But would I be any happier?</p>
<p>I rode up the elevator with a feeling of dread in my heart.  I didn&rsquo;t know what John was going to say this week, and while I knew what I had to do I didn&rsquo;t want him telling me I had to do it. Letticia was wearing her glasses again, and when she saw me her face lit up. I looked at her and thought that she would be my perfect glasses wearing lady if only John didn&rsquo;t have her for his own.  And he probably didn&rsquo;t even appreciate her like I would have.</p>
<p>I walked into the office and John was sitting at his desk. He looked up and I noticed that he was wearing a pair of glasses. As I took a closer look I could see that they were a fairly high minus. He had never said anything about wearing glasses on any of my previous visits.</p>
<p>“Sit down in the chair Dave.  I don&rsquo;t think we need the couch for today.  How do you like my glasses?” John asked.</p>
<p>“They look really nice.  They are fairly strong though, so I guess you have always worn contact lenses.&quot; I replied.</p>
<p>“Actually I didn&rsquo;t start wearing contact lenses until I got the glasses. Thanks to you I went to a friend of mine who is an optometrist, and he fitted me with a GOC combination. I had wanted glasses as strong as yours and Letticia&rsquo;s are, but my friend suggested that -15D would be strong enough for my first attempt.  And I think he was right. I really like them.” John said.</p>
<p>“That is a switch. Here I am thinking I am crazy and now my psychiatrist has contacted my fetish.” I told him.</p>
<p>“Actually Dave, I have always had the fetish. I just didn&rsquo;t know how badly I had it until I talked with you.  I would never have gone out with Letty if I hadn&rsquo;t seen her wearing her glasses one day.  That was enough to make me ask her out, and after I had seen her wearing glasses a few times in private I knew I had to marry her.  But you were the one who opened my eyes.” John replied.</p>
<p>“So am I not crazy, or are we both a bit crazy?&rsquo; I asked</p>
<p>“We both have a similar fetish. Just because a person has a fetish it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are mentally ill. You were worried that your fetish has started to take over your life, and that is what brought you to me. I think that you know that you have to cut back on the time that you are spending on your fetish, but I see no reason why you have to get rid of everything associated with the fetish.” John stated.</p>
<p>“Well that is a relief.  I was going to tell you that there was no way I could cut everything out, and I was going to stop coming to see you.” I replied.</p>
<p>“Yes, I suspected that would be your decision.  But I don&rsquo;t want you to stop coming to see me. I would love to have you drop by and Letty and I could go for lunch with you once in a while. I owe you so much for helping me bring my fetish out into the open.” John said.</p>
<p>“I would be happy to do that John.  And by the way – Letty would be the perfect lady that I have been searching for.  I am glad that someone has her that appreciates what he has.” I told him.</p>
