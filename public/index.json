Wooohoo üéâüéâüéâüé∂ - February 6, 2019 # \u0026ldquo;Fun fact, I actually originally wrote the one for me on ukulele. Fun fact of the day. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to think of how I did it, though, because it\u0026rsquo;s different. I think it\u0026rsquo;s different than what I do on guitar, because I can\u0026rsquo;t remember. Because for the chorus on guitar, I don\u0026rsquo;t have an Am in there, but then when I do it on the ukulele, I add an Am in the chorus. So, I\u0026rsquo;m going to do that.\u0026rdquo;\nfunfact for day 7: my song ‚ÄúThe One For Me‚Äù was originally written on ukulele!! - April 16, 2019 # #funfact for day 7: my #song ‚ÄúThe One For Me‚Äù was originally #written on #ukulele!!\nThursday night live!!
