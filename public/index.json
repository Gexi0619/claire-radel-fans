Thank you to the awesome production by @courtstreetproduction and to my co-writer @trevorpeverley for always helping bring ideas to life!!\nWe wrote this song back in 2021, and I’ve always loved it. I remember when we were writing the bridge and the phrasing / melody just seemed to flow out. (That’s also my favorite part of the song ). This song is for those of you going through heartbreak, loss, difficult times or anything that you feel can relate this to. Much love and I’m so thankful to work with such talented people! Visual # Can anyone else relate?….Pre-save “To You” so I’m no longer sad .\nComing March 29th! Link in biooooo pre-save for my upcoming single “To You” is available now! Here’s me being dramatic on my living room floor hope you enjoy this sneak peek of the song! Coming out March 29th!!!\nWritten with @trevorpeverley Reviews # lefuturewave # Indiana/Nashville based singer, songwriter and producer Claire Randel is ready to share with the world her new single, To You. Solidified by acoustic guitars, the sound takes on an alternative / folk touch. Soft drums bring the rhythm slowly forward. The strings in the background conjure up the sensation of a rainbow floating in the sky.\nTo You fixes attention on heartbreak and the effort to help someone who needs it. Both of these subjects are heartfelt, spinning around the soul and making you wiser in the process. Claire keeps things real at all times.\nCheck out To You below!\nlink\nMelodic Magazine # Independent pop artist Claire Radel released her latest single, “To You,” on March 29. The song, written by Radel and Canada based producer/songwriter, Trevor Peverley in 2021, boasts a runtime of nearly five minutes. With a blend of folk-pop and singer-songwriter elements, “To You” showcases Radel’s soft, airy vocals floating over — and dancing above — a bright, soothing production. The track aims to offer solace to those grappling with heartbreak.\nIn poignant lyrics like, “Say you don’t but I know you see the issue / Maybe you just want someone to fix you,” Radel captures the essence of the song’s reflective sentiments. The song exudes a warmth and sincerity that is often unheard of in music today. It evokes a sense of passionate friendship amidst the tough times. The song serves as heartfelt, and warm and makes you feel like you have a friend in the world. “To You” is a sweet ode to those navigating through heartbreak, loss or challenging times.\nlink\n","date":"Mar 24, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/releases/to-you/","section":"Releases","summary":"Releases # more Behind the Scene # Some quick behind the scenes in the studio for my upcoming song “To You”!","title":"To You","type":"releases"},{"content":"","date":"Mar 24, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/trevorpeverley/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Trevorpeverley","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Mar 24, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/","section":"Covers","summary":"","title":"Covers","type":"covers"},{"content":" “Just In Case” @morganjohnstonmusic one of my favorite songs!

Lyrics # He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee\nHe doesn\u0026rsquo;t care if my hair\u0026rsquo;s all fixed up or messy\nHe says he can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference on whether or not I have on makeup\nAnd he texts me every morning whenever he wakes up\nNever thought I\u0026rsquo;d find someone else like him again\nBut I swear this one\u0026rsquo;s better than the rest of them\nCuz this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\nMy friends say we got something special\nAnd everything with us is natural\nI think that they wish that they had it\nCause the boys that they\u0026rsquo;re with have been too dramatic\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\nEven through ups and downs we still make it\nAnd I know when you say I love you you don\u0026rsquo;t fake it\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\nVisual # Spotify Canvas Art # View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\n✨Here is the Spotify canvas art for “Looking No More” - can you guess what the other photos are? 👀✨\nPoster # albulm # Reviews # Caesar Live N Loud # \u0026hellip; a smooth, warm pop song about being in love, \u0026amp; the feeling of being with someone who’s good for you.\nlink\nRoadie Music # \u0026hellip; ele trafega entre nuances do Pop e do Folk, gerando de tal forma uma música muito agradável de se ouvir, com ótimas melodias e arranjos, capazes de envolver o ouvinte durante a audição, tudo complementado pela ótima voz de Claire. Aproveitando o lançamento, ela falou um pouco mais a respeito da nova música:\n“Essa música é uma versão honesta de estar apaixonado e o sentimento e a realidade de estar com alguém que é bom para você. Onde você não precisa continuar procurando “aquele” porque encontrou a pessoa com quem deseja estar.”\nEnglish version:\n\u0026hellip; it travels between Pop and Folk nuances, generating in such a way a very pleasant song to listen to, with great melodies and arrangements, capable of involving the listener during the audition, all complemented by the great voice of Claire. Taking advantage of the launch, she spoke a little more about the new song:\n“This song is an honest version of being in love and the feeling and reality of being with someone who is good for you. Where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep looking for \u0026ldquo;the one\u0026rdquo; because you\u0026rsquo;ve found the person you want to be with.\u0026quot;\nlink\nFierce \u0026amp; Fabulous Rebolution # This single centres around discovering that certain someone you deeply fall for \u0026amp; sincerely trust. You no longer need to search for someone to keep the spark alive, as you’ve already found them.\nThe song carries a soulful-pop influence that gradually glides alongside the lyrics to provide a foundation for the lyrical story to take centre stage.\nClaire provides a feel-good vocal performance that highlights the heartfelt characteristics within the beautifully divine undertones of her soulfully gratifying voice.\nThis song shows a new side of Claire’s musical talents while remaining in keeping with the unique creative spark we’ve come to love from this talented musician. Claire is a wonderful lyricist who brings a sense of heartfelt significance with every song \u0026amp; this latest piece is clearly no exception.\nlink\nMusic On The Move # Whether it be romantic or platonic, we’ve all experienced an abrupt departure from someone we loved, seemingly out of nowhere. Perfectly captured in poignant lyrics like, “Something’s missing tonight/ I’m in your sweater but I feel colder”, Radel takes you through the rollercoaster of emotions that come when a relationship ends unexpectedly. Set against musical accompaniment that feels as calming, yet equally enveloping as an ocean wave, ‘Like You Love Me’ is bound to make every emotion wash over you, all in the span of three minutes. Press play and go feel your feelings, friend!\nlink\n","date":"Apr 23, 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/releases/looking-no-more/","section":"Releases","summary":"Releases # more Behind the Scene # Looking No More - Behind the scenes @ Court Street Recording # The official behind the scenes video of “Looking No More” recording session - Claire Radel and Michael Estok @ Court Street Recording.","title":"Looking No More","type":"releases"},{"content":" View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\n","date":"Jul 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/demos/guitar-solo-mi-sol-la/","section":"Demos","summary":"View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)","title":"Guitar Solo Mi Sol La","type":"demos"},{"content":"","date":"Jul 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/instrumental/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Instrumental","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Jul 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/solo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Solo","type":"tags"},{"content":" View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\n","date":"Apr 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/albums/creative-coner/","section":"Albums","summary":"View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)","title":"Creative Coner","type":"albums"},{"content":"","date":"Apr 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/produce/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Produce","type":"tags"},{"content":" View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\n","date":"Mar 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/demos/i-ii-iv/","section":"Demos","summary":"View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)","title":"I II IV","type":"demos"},{"content":" View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\n","date":"Mar 22, 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/demos/sol-la-do-la/","section":"Demos","summary":"View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)","title":"Sol La Do La","type":"demos"},{"content":" View this post on Instagram A post shared by claire radel 🧚‍♀️✨ (@claireradelmusic)\nsharing a demo I created of a song I wrote last year called “break my heart”!!!

It\u0026rsquo;s called Like You Love Me. It\u0026rsquo;s a song I wrote with Marcus Waddell that I met earlier this year. He\u0026rsquo;s a producer based in Indianapolis. He\u0026rsquo;s super cool to work with. I\u0026rsquo;m really excited for this song because it\u0026rsquo;s good. It\u0026rsquo;s a good one. So I\u0026rsquo;ll play that one now.

And it\u0026rsquo;s my own song. And you\u0026rsquo;d think that I would like know. But when you don\u0026rsquo;t play shows for like a month. And it\u0026rsquo;s like oh I don\u0026rsquo;t have to practice for anything. And you\u0026rsquo;re just like okay cool. I can just sit on my phone all day. But then when I go to do this I\u0026rsquo;m like okay no. I actually have to be prepared. So this is another original. And this is called Like you love me. And I\u0026rsquo;ve played this out on here before. But this is new. And this is gonna be released this year. I just need to get pictures done. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of taking a little bit of time.

And I hope you guys like it.\nLive - May 7, 2020 # And this is called Like You Love Me, so I hope you guys enjoy.\nLive - May 21, 2020 # I\u0026rsquo;m so excited because, you know why? Um, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a song coming out in 13 days. Not like I\u0026rsquo;ve been counting down or anything, you know? Um, so I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about that. That\u0026rsquo;s coming out June 3rd. And I originally meant for it to be released July 3rd, but I\u0026rsquo;m terrible with months, so I am sticking to June 3rd instead. So, it is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo; And, um, I wrote it with my producer friend, Marcus Waddell. And he\u0026rsquo;s super cool and awesome, and he\u0026rsquo;s really good at what he does. And he\u0026rsquo;s super cool to work with. I had a really great time working with him. And you guys should also go check out his stuff because he\u0026rsquo;s got his own independent stuff that he does too. And it\u0026rsquo;s under \u0026ldquo;Cradle Cat,\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s really good. He does all his production, and it\u0026rsquo;s like I wish I could be as good as him because he\u0026rsquo;s still learning. So we\u0026rsquo;re both, like, learning together, and it\u0026rsquo;s really cool just to have someone that knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing but they\u0026rsquo;re still learning more about their craft. Um, so it\u0026rsquo;s really fun to work with him. So, be on the lookout for that one. That\u0026rsquo;s June 3rd, so that\u0026rsquo;s coming up soon. And I\u0026rsquo;ll start off with that one. So, I hope you guys like it. Alright, I hope you guys enjoy this one. This is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo;\n35:10\nSo, I thought I would fill you guys in on my next single that I will be releasing. It comes out on June 3rd, and I\u0026rsquo;m super excited. I would play you a snippet of it, but I already posted that one video with about 9 seconds on it. Anyway, the song is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me,\u0026rdquo; and it comes out in like 13 days. For that, I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a virtual release party. I\u0026rsquo;ll start that at 10 PM on the 2nd and then go until 12 AM on the 3rd. That way, I\u0026rsquo;ll be awake when it releases at 12 AM on the 3rd. If you would like to join me for that, feel free. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna have a party. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna set up some Christmas lights, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna bake cookies. I hope you guys like it because I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about it, and it\u0026rsquo;s new and stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna see if I can get some t-shirts made. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a limited amount and just do a giveaway. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some other ideas for some stuff, not a lot, nothing too crazy.\nAlso, one of my other friends, his name\u0026rsquo;s DeRay, he\u0026rsquo;s super cool. He has an album coming out on the 12th of June, and I\u0026rsquo;m featured on one of his tracks. So, I really appreciate him allowing me to collaborate and write some lyrics for the song. You guys should check that out too because that\u0026rsquo;s gonna be dope. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be super cool. I\u0026rsquo;m excited.

But yeah, we\u0026rsquo;ve got some cool stuff coming out this year.\nAnd I also, not only those two, but I have a song that I\u0026rsquo;ll be releasing, another single, besides \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo; And that one I worked on with Corey West. It\u0026rsquo;s a song that I had already had a track on my phone or on my iPad that I had built up. Later, I transferred it to my phone and just worked on it that way. I brought it to him and was like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, can you help me do this because I\u0026rsquo;m not very tech-savvy when it comes to production yet?\u0026rdquo; Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it for about a year, just messing around with it last summer. I do stuff on my phone and now my iPad, but I\u0026rsquo;m nowhere near where I want to be. But I\u0026rsquo;m still working on it.\nAnyway, with that one, I was like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, can you help me with this?\u0026rdquo; And he was like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, for sure.\u0026rdquo; So, he just helped me with the production side of everything because I\u0026rsquo;m not that good at that stuff yet. So, that one\u0026rsquo;s super cool. They\u0026rsquo;re both very much different.\nLive - June 1, 2023 # I didn’t win tonight’s competitions - but I did win in new connections, hearing really great songwriters and being surrounded by such an encouraging group of people!!!

There was a crap ton of drama that I was not really a part of. I was friends with this girl who had a thing for a guy who had a girlfriend. And so he ended up cheating on his girlfriend. And she found out. They were together still. And someone\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n30:24 Back to my story from a few minutes ago.

They broke up. And they\u0026rsquo;re still together. And it\u0026rsquo;s been like two years now. So it\u0026rsquo;s crazy.\u0026quot;\nLive - May 8, 2020 # \u0026ldquo;One more song, and this is called You\u0026rsquo;re Askin\u0026rsquo; For It, off of my EP. And this is inspired by a friend of mine in high school. There was like a ton of drama my senior year. And she, this guy she liked, had a girlfriend. And he cheated on his girlfriend to be with her. And then they ended up breaking up. And then now they\u0026rsquo;ve been together for like two years. And when I told her that like I wrote a song about it, she was like, \u0026lsquo;Oh that\u0026rsquo;s so cool.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;m just like, \u0026lsquo;Okay, well, whatever.\u0026rsquo; But this is called You\u0026rsquo;re Askin\u0026rsquo; For It.

I think it\u0026rsquo;s different than what I do on guitar, because I can\u0026rsquo;t remember. Because for the chorus on guitar, I don\u0026rsquo;t have an Am in there, but then when I do it on the ukulele, I add an Am in the chorus.

Xx- Claire\nMemphis at South Main Sounds - July 1, 2017 # My first performance in Memphis at South Main Sounds!\nLive - April 15, 2023 # What was the first song you played at Bluebird? Uh, that\u0026rsquo;s been a really long time ago. The first time I played at Bluebird was in like 2017. Um, I think I, what did I do then? I probably did Your Lovin\u0026rsquo; and You, which is like the first song I put out. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played that one in a really long time. Um, but I can attempt it. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. This is like throwback to me when I was like, I think I wrote this when I was like 16. And it was after, it was after like this open mic night that I had that I went to. And I met this guy and I thought he was cute. And then I went home and I like wrote this song down. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s like, has any correlation to the song. I don\u0026rsquo;t really think it does. But, you know what? I can say that that guy inspired it. Kind of. Just cause he was cute. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe not. Um, but anyways. I just remember that. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any paper, like I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any notebook paper to write it down on. So I remember, um, I think I still have it, but I think I wrote it down on like an envelope that I found. Um, and I just like wrote it all down and then I woke up the next day and I like just put a melody to it. And then it, and then there it was. So that\u0026rsquo;s the little backstory behind that song that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve shared before. Um, but anyways. I\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to play it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played it in a really long time.\nLyrics # I don\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of money\nOr my name in lights\nAll I want is your lovin\u0026rsquo; everyday and night\nSome people don\u0026rsquo;t know how to live their life\nBut I think I\u0026rsquo;ve finally got it right\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been all around the country seen some beautiful sights\nBut the best part of it all is when you\u0026rsquo;d hold me at night\nCan\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;ve found someone like you\nHonestly you\u0026rsquo;re like a dream come true\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nI feel so alone when you\u0026rsquo;re gone\nBut I know our love will always stay strong, strong\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you.\n","date":"Dec 16, 2016","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/releases/your-lovin-and-you/","section":"Releases","summary":"Release # more Lives # Orangehaus Music Business Camp - July 17, 2016 # So honored to be chosen for this year\u0026rsquo;s compilation album at Orangehaus Music Business Camp!","title":"Your Lovin and You","type":"releases"},{"content":" ","date":"Dec 16, 2016","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/dont--know-why/","section":"Covers","summary":" ","title":"Don't Know Why","type":"covers"},{"content":" Practice - August 22, 2017 # Picked this up a few days ago..a bit rough..😅 Can you guess the song?\nPractice - November 10, 2017 # #Blackbird #TheBeatles #Guitar #IndianaMusician #Singer #songwriter #Claireradelmusic\nPerformance - Dcember 16, 2017\n#Blackbird #Singer #guitarist #TheBeatles #Claireradelmusic #music #classic\n","date":"Feb 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/black-bird/","section":"Covers","summary":"Practice - August 22, 2017 # Picked this up a few days ago.","title":"Black Bird","type":"covers"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Blank Space, Style Mashup\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Feb 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/blank-space-style-mashup/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Blank Space, Style Mashup\u0026rdquo;","title":"Blank Space, Style Mashup","type":"covers"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/duet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Duet","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/my-favorite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"My Favorite","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/stage/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Stage","type":"tags"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come away with me\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Jan 15, 2015","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/come-away-with-me/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come away with me\u0026rdquo;","title":"Come away with me","type":"covers"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come around\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Dec 14, 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/come-around/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come around\u0026rdquo;","title":"Come around","type":"covers"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;riptide\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Dec 14, 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/riptide/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;riptide\u0026rdquo;","title":"Riptide","type":"covers"},{"content":"My second time performing at Rhum Academy. -\u0026ldquo;Hazy\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Nov 14, 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/covers/hazy/","section":"Covers","summary":"My second time performing at Rhum Academy.","title":"Hazy","type":"covers"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 14, 2014","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/rhum-academy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rhum Academy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
