She released her first EP in 2018 \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re Askin\u0026rsquo; for It\u0026rdquo; which garnered a comment from mentor Doug Showalter (producer/guitarist/drummer who has worked with country singer Cam, Harry Styles, Lennon Stella, Maren Morris, Miley Cyrus and many others) he gave an encouraging review:\n\u0026ldquo;Claire Radel has a voice and narrative that is far beyond her years. Her ability to tell stories of teenage love in a way that any listener can relate to showcases a talent that has the brightest of bright futures. Brighter then she’s probably even aware of. And that’s a very good thing.\u0026rdquo;\nThroughout the past several years she has continued to hone in her sound, experimenting with folk-pop and indie influences while working with former SONY/ATV Nashville producer Michael Estok. Her latest song \u0026ldquo;The One\u0026rdquo; released in 2021 caught the attention of film and TV publishing company The Music Playground in New York city, which lead her to sign her first sync licensing deal; that same year she was recognized by the Nashville Songwriters Association as \u0026ldquo;One to Watch\u0026rdquo;.\nClaire has performed at many notable venues over the past several years in Nashville, TN (The Bluebird Café / The Listening Room, Pigeon Forge) and in her home state of Indiana. One notable opportunity was in 2017, opening for American Idol winner David Cook for a local music festival.\nShe is now living full time in Nashville, TN after traveling back and forth from Indiana at the age of 13, where she continues to chase her dreams, write songs, perform, and continues to produce music. Claire has several new songs coming out this year and plans to become more immersed in the Nashville music scene.\n——from the website of Claire\n","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/about/","section":"Posts","summary":"After learning guitar from her older brother and through music lessons at the ripe age of twelve while writing songs at the same time, Claire Radel\u0026rsquo;s musical journey has bloomed ever since.","title":"About Claire"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" Releases # more Lives # Live @ Dawghouse Saloon - June 21, 2023 # Lyrics # He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee\nHe doesn\u0026rsquo;t care if my hair\u0026rsquo;s all fixed up or messy\nHe says he can\u0026rsquo;t tell the difference on whether or not I have on makeup\nAnd he texts me every morning whenever he wakes up\nNever thought I\u0026rsquo;d find someone else like him again\nBut I swear this one\u0026rsquo;s better than the rest of them\nCuz this is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\nMy friends say we got something special\nAnd everything with us is natural\nI think that they wish that they had it\nCause the boys that they\u0026rsquo;re with have been too dramatic\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\nEven through ups and downs we still make it\nAnd I know when you say I love you you don\u0026rsquo;t fake it\nThis is the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve fallen\nI can truly be free\nWith someone who wants nothing but to\nBe the best for me\nAll of my past aches and mistakes\nCould have only done one thing\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s led me to you and now I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep\nLooking no more\nLooking no more\n","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/songs/looking-no-more/","section":"Songs","summary":"Releases # more Lives # Live @ Dawghouse Saloon - June 21, 2023 # Lyrics # He thinks I look pretty in sweatpants and a tee","title":"Looking No More"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/release/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"release"},{"content":"building\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=868292159990447\n","date":"11 June 2021","permalink":"/songs/the-one/","section":"Songs","summary":"building","title":"The One"},{"content":"building\n","date":"7 August 2020","permalink":"/songs/not-what-i-want/","section":"Songs","summary":"building","title":"Not What I Want"},{"content":"building\n","date":"3 June 2020","permalink":"/songs/like-you-love-me/","section":"Songs","summary":"building","title":"Like You Love Me"},{"content":" Releases # more Claire Radel · Claire Radel You\u0026#x27;re Askin\u0026#x27; For It Behind The Scenes # THE MAKING OF MY DEBUT EP - October 16, 2018 # I had such a GREAT time making my first EP!!!

Because for the chorus on guitar, I don\u0026rsquo;t have an Am in there, but then when I do it on the ukulele, I add an Am in the chorus.
