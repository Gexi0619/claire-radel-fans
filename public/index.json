Aproveitando o lan√ßamento, ela falou um pouco mais a respeito da nova m√∫sica:\n‚ÄúEssa m√∫sica √© uma vers√£o honesta de estar apaixonado e o sentimento e a realidade de estar com algu√©m que √© bom para voc√™.

Taking advantage of the launch, she spoke a little more about the new song:\n‚ÄúThis song is an honest version of being in love and the feeling and reality of being with someone who is good for you. Where you don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep looking for \u0026ldquo;the one\u0026rdquo; because you\u0026rsquo;ve found the person you want to be with.\u0026quot;\nlink\nFierce \u0026amp; Fabulous Rebolution # This single centres around discovering that certain someone you deeply fall for \u0026amp; sincerely trust. You no longer need to search for someone to keep the spark alive, as you‚Äôve already found them.\nThe song carries a soulful-pop influence that gradually glides alongside the lyrics to provide a foundation for the lyrical story to take centre stage.\nClaire provides a feel-good vocal performance that highlights the heartfelt characteristics within the beautifully divine undertones of her soulfully gratifying voice.\nThis song shows a new side of Claire‚Äôs musical talents while remaining in keeping with the unique creative spark we‚Äôve come to love from this talented musician. Claire is a wonderful lyricist who brings a sense of heartfelt significance with every song \u0026amp; this latest piece is clearly no exception.\nlink\nMusic On The Move # Whether it be romantic or platonic, we‚Äôve all experienced an abrupt departure from someone we loved, seemingly out of nowhere. Perfectly captured in poignant lyrics like, ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs missing tonight/ I‚Äôm in your sweater but I feel colder‚Äù, Radel takes you through the rollercoaster of emotions that come when a relationship ends unexpectedly. Set against musical accompaniment that feels as calming, yet equally enveloping as an ocean wave, ‚ÄòLike You Love Me‚Äô is bound to make every emotion wash over you, all in the span of three minutes. Press play and go feel your feelings, friend!\nlink\n","date":"Apr 23, 2023","permalink":"/releases/looking-no-more/","section":"Releases","summary":"Releases # more Behind the Scene # Looking No More -

And I\u0026rsquo;ve played this out on here before. But this is new. And this is gonna be released this year. I just need to get pictures done. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of taking a little bit of time.

That\u0026rsquo;s coming out June 3rd. And I originally meant for it to be released July 3rd, but I\u0026rsquo;m terrible with months, so I am sticking to June 3rd instead. So, it is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo; And, um, I wrote it with my producer friend, Marcus Waddell. And he\u0026rsquo;s super cool and awesome, and he\u0026rsquo;s really good at what he does. And he\u0026rsquo;s super cool to work with. I had a really great time working with him. And you guys should also go check out his stuff because he\u0026rsquo;s got his own independent stuff that he does too. And it\u0026rsquo;s under \u0026ldquo;Cradle Cat,\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s really good. He does all his production, and it\u0026rsquo;s like I wish I could be as good as him because he\u0026rsquo;s still learning. So we\u0026rsquo;re both, like, learning together, and it\u0026rsquo;s really cool just to have someone that knows what they\u0026rsquo;re doing but they\u0026rsquo;re still learning more about their craft. Um, so it\u0026rsquo;s really fun to work with him. So, be on the lookout for that one. That\u0026rsquo;s June 3rd, so that\u0026rsquo;s coming up soon. And I\u0026rsquo;ll start off with that one. So, I hope you guys like it. Alright, I hope you guys enjoy this one. This is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo;\n35:10\nSo, I thought I would fill you guys in on my next single that I will be releasing. It comes out on June 3rd, and I\u0026rsquo;m super excited. I would play you a snippet of it, but I already posted that one video with about 9 seconds on it. Anyway, the song is called \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me,\u0026rdquo; and it comes out in like 13 days. For that, I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing a virtual release party. I\u0026rsquo;ll start that at 10 PM on the 2nd and then go until 12 AM on the 3rd. That way, I\u0026rsquo;ll be awake when it releases at 12 AM on the 3rd. If you would like to join me for that, feel free. We\u0026rsquo;re gonna have a party. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna set up some Christmas lights, and I\u0026rsquo;m gonna bake cookies. I hope you guys like it because I\u0026rsquo;m really excited about it, and it\u0026rsquo;s new and stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna see if I can get some t-shirts made. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do a limited amount and just do a giveaway. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some other ideas for some stuff, not a lot, nothing too crazy.\nAlso, one of my other friends, his name\u0026rsquo;s DeRay, he\u0026rsquo;s super cool. He has an album coming out on the 12th of June, and I\u0026rsquo;m featured on one of his tracks. So, I really appreciate him allowing me to collaborate and write some lyrics for the song. You guys should check that out too because that\u0026rsquo;s gonna be dope. It\u0026rsquo;s gonna be super cool. I\u0026rsquo;m excited. I haven\u0026rsquo;t even heard the finished product yet, so I don\u0026rsquo;t even know what it\u0026rsquo;s gonna sound like. But yeah, we\u0026rsquo;ve got some cool stuff coming out this year.\nAnd I also, not only those two, but I have a song that I\u0026rsquo;ll be releasing, another single, besides \u0026ldquo;Like You Love Me.\u0026rdquo; And that one I worked on with Corey West. It\u0026rsquo;s a song that I had already had a track on my phone or on my iPad that I had built up. Later, I transferred it to my phone and just worked on it that way. I brought it to him and was like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, can you help me do this because I\u0026rsquo;m not very tech-savvy when it comes to production yet?\u0026rdquo; Even though I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it for about a year, just messing around with it last summer. I do stuff on my phone and now my iPad, but I\u0026rsquo;m nowhere near where I want to be. But I\u0026rsquo;m still working on it.\nAnyway, with that one, I was like, \u0026ldquo;Hey, can you help me with this?\u0026rdquo; And he was like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, for sure.\u0026rdquo; So, he just helped me with the production side of everything because I\u0026rsquo;m not that good at that stuff yet. So, that one\u0026rsquo;s super cool. They\u0026rsquo;re both very much different.\n","date":"Jun 20, 2020","permalink":"/releases/like-you-love-me/","section":"Releases","summary":"Releases # more Lives # Live - Nov 16, 2019 # I thought I would do one and give you a little bit of an update on my music.","title":"Like You Love Me"},{"content":" ","date":"Jun 20, 2020","permalink":"/mds3/20200603-1205503239785382/","section":"Mds3s","summary":" ","title":"20200603 -

Xx- Claire\nMemphis at South Main Sounds - July 1, 2017 # My first performance in Memphis at South Main Sounds!\nLive - April 15, 2023 # What was the first song you played at Bluebird? Uh, that\u0026rsquo;s been a really long time ago. The first time I played at Bluebird was in like 2017. Um, I think I, what did I do then? I probably did Your Lovin\u0026rsquo; and You, which is like the first song I put out. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played that one in a really long time. Um, but I can attempt it. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. This is like throwback to me when I was like, I think I wrote this when I was like 16. And it was after, it was after like this open mic night that I had that I went to. And I met this guy and I thought he was cute. And then I went home and I like wrote this song down. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s like, has any correlation to the song. I don\u0026rsquo;t really think it does. But, you know what? I can say that that guy inspired it. Kind of. Just cause he was cute. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe not. Um, but anyways. I just remember that. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any paper, like I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any notebook paper to write it down on. So I remember, um, I think I still have it, but I think I wrote it down on like an envelope that I found. Um, and I just like wrote it all down and then I woke up the next day and I like just put a melody to it. And then it, and then there it was. So that\u0026rsquo;s the little backstory behind that song that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve shared before. Um, but anyways. I\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to play it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played it in a really long time.\nLyrics # I don\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of money\nOr my name in lights\nAll I want is your lovin\u0026rsquo; everyday and night\nSome people don\u0026rsquo;t know how to live their life\nBut I think I\u0026rsquo;ve finally got it right\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been all around the country seen some beautiful sights\nBut the best part of it all is when you\u0026rsquo;d hold me at night\nCan\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;ve found someone like you\nHonestly you\u0026rsquo;re like a dream come true\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nI feel so alone when you\u0026rsquo;re gone\nBut I know our love will always stay strong, strong\nCause all your lovin\u0026rsquo; is all I need\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enough to keep me standing on my feet\nDoesn\u0026rsquo;t matter where I go\nOr what I do\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you\nAs long as I\u0026rsquo;ve got your lovin\u0026rsquo; and you.\n","date":"Dec 16, 2016","permalink":"/releases/your-lovin-and-you/","section":"Releases","summary":"Release # more Lives # Orangehaus Music Business Camp - July 17, 2016 # So honored to be chosen for this year\u0026rsquo;s compilation album at Orangehaus Music Business Camp!","title":"Your Lovin and You"},{"content":" ","date":"Dec 16, 2016","permalink":"/covers/dont-know-why/","section":"Covers","summary":" ","title":"Don't Know Why"},{"content":" Practice - August 22, 2017 # Picked this up a few days ago..a bit rough..üòÖ Can you guess the song?\nPractice - November 10, 2017 # #Blackbird #TheBeatles #Guitar #IndianaMusician #Singer #songwriter #Claireradelmusic\nPerformance - Dcember 16, 2017\n#Blackbird #Singer #guitarist #TheBeatles #Claireradelmusic #music #classic\n","date":"Feb 15, 2015","permalink":"/covers/black-bird/","section":"Covers","summary":"Practice - August 22, 2017 # Picked this up a few days ago.","title":"Black Bird"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Blank Space, Style Mashup\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Feb 15, 2015","permalink":"/covers/blank-space-style-mashup/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Blank Space, Style Mashup\u0026rdquo;","title":"Blank Space, Style Mashup"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","permalink":"/tags/duet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"duet"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","permalink":"/tags/my-favorite/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"my favorite"},{"content":"","date":"Feb 15, 2015","permalink":"/tags/stage/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"stage"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come away with me\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Jan 15, 2015","permalink":"/covers/come-away-with-me/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come away with me\u0026rdquo;","title":"Come away with me"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come around\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Dec 14, 2014","permalink":"/covers/come-around/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;Come around\u0026rdquo;","title":"Come around"},{"content":"Claire \u0026ldquo;riptide\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Dec 14, 2014","permalink":"/covers/riptide/","section":"Covers","summary":"Claire \u0026ldquo;riptide\u0026rdquo;","title":"Riptide"},{"content":"My second time performing at Rhum Academy. -\u0026ldquo;Hazy\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"Nov 14, 2014","permalink":"/covers/hazy/","section":"Covers","summary":"My second time performing at Rhum Academy.","title":"Hazy"},{"content":"","date":"Nov 14, 2014","permalink":"/tags/rhum-academy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"rhum academy"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"Jan 01, 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"}]
