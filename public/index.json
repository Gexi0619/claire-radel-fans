Aproveitando o lan√ßamento, ela falou um pouco mais a respeito da nova m√∫sica:\n‚ÄúEssa m√∫sica √© uma vers√£o honesta de estar apaixonado e o sentimento e a realidade de estar com algu√©m que √© bom para voc√™.

Taking advantage of the launch, she spoke a little more about the new song:\n‚ÄúThis song is an honest version of being in love and the feeling and reality of being with someone who is good for you.

You no longer need to search for someone to keep the spark alive, as you‚Äôve already found them.\nThe song carries a soulful-pop influence that gradually glides alongside the lyrics to provide a foundation for the lyrical story to take centre stage.\nClaire provides a feel-good vocal performance that highlights the heartfelt characteristics within the beautifully divine undertones of her soulfully gratifying voice.\nThis song shows a new side of Claire‚Äôs musical talents while remaining in keeping with the unique creative spark we‚Äôve come to love from this talented musician. Claire is a wonderful lyricist who brings a sense of heartfelt significance with every song \u0026amp; this latest piece is clearly no exception.\nlink\nMusic On The Move # Whether it be romantic or platonic, we‚Äôve all experienced an abrupt departure from someone we loved, seemingly out of nowhere. Perfectly captured in poignant lyrics like, ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs missing tonight/ I‚Äôm in your sweater but I feel colder‚Äù, Radel takes you through the rollercoaster of emotions that come when a relationship ends unexpectedly. Set against musical accompaniment that feels as calming, yet equally enveloping as an ocean wave, ‚ÄòLike You Love Me‚Äô is bound to make every emotion wash over you, all in the span of three minutes.

Xx- Claire\nMy first performance in Memphis at South Main Sounds! - July 1, 2017 # My first performance in Memphis at South Main Sounds!\nLive - April 15, 2023 # What was the first song you played at Bluebird? Uh, that\u0026rsquo;s been a really long time ago. The first time I played at Bluebird was in like 2017. Um, I think I, what did I do then? I probably did Your Lovin\u0026rsquo; and You, which is like the first song I put out. I haven\u0026rsquo;t played that one in a really long time. Um, but I can attempt it. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how it goes. This is like throwback to me when I was like, I think I wrote this when I was like 16. And it was after, it was after like this open mic night that I had that I went to. And I met this guy and I thought he was cute. And then I went home and I like wrote this song down. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s like, has any correlation to the song. I don\u0026rsquo;t really think it does. But, you know what? I can say that that guy inspired it. Kind of. Just cause he was cute. I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Maybe not. Um, but anyways. I just remember that. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any paper, like I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any notebook paper to write it down on. So I remember, um, I think I still have it, but I think I wrote it down on like an envelope that I found. Um, and I just like wrote it all down and then I woke up the next day and I like just put a melody to it. And then it, and then there it was. So that\u0026rsquo;s the little backstory behind that song that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ve shared before. Um, but anyways. I\u0026rsquo;ll attempt to play it.
